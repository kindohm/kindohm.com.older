You can download the fully built library at  <a href="https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/audiolib.js/downloads">github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/audiolib.js/downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Many congrats go to <a href="https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski">Jussi Kalliokoski</a>, who has done the bulk of the work on this project.</p>
<p>I'm especially excited about this release because I actually contributed a small amount to it. I haven't been active in <em>useful</em> open source projects in the past, so actually seeing a release that includes code I worked on is very satisfying.</p>
<p>If you are a synthesizer geek and a programmer, I highly recommend checking out audiolib.js. It's a big sandbox of fun!</p>
