title: "Standing Desk: One Week Later"
---

<p>On Monday this week I <a href="http://kindohm.com/blog/2012/08/27/standing-desk-day-0/">assembled and started using a standing desk</a> at the office. I want to share my experience of how the design of this desk is working as well as how the work week has gone - including how pair programming has worked with the desk.</p>

<h2>Assembly and Adjustments</h2>
<ul>
<li>First off, if you use this design: <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html</a> (as I did), be prepared to make small adjustments over the first week. Every person's body geometry and computer hardware needs are different and those instructions will probably get you 90% of the way there. You may actually need to unscrew and disassemble some of your work in order to do this. For example, I had to raise my shelf brackets near the end of this week.</li>
<li>
<p>If you use a two-table design for two monitors, do not center the keyboard shelf on one table. If you do that then your secondary monitor will be far to one side. Instead, offset the keyboard shelf so that it is closer to where the two tables meet:</p>
<p><a href="/hodsmedia/photo7.jpg"><img src="/hodsmedia/photo7.jpg" alt="" title="photo(7)" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>In my specific case, I put the shelf all the way to the right on one of the tables so that the left edge of the shelf is flush with the left edge of the table leg. In addition, you can also move the monitors to one side of the tables so that your entire set up is centered (look at the first photo in this post to see what that looks like).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep in mind that this is <em>Ikea</em> furniture. I love Ikea, but you get what you pay for (the whole point of this desk was low cost, so I'm OK with lower quality). Be careful with the screws and do not over-tighten anything. These side tables are not designed to be screwed in to and they are not solid wood. The shelf brackets are also not very durable, so be very careful with screws:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Using the Desk</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've been very surprised at how little pain there was in my feet and legs this first week.</li>
<li>My legs get tired, but they don't hurt. Toward the middle of the day I feel like I need to stretch my legs a lot.</li>
<li>Stand straight and don't shift your weight to one hip. Don't lean on anything. You'll just mess up your back. I'm not an ergonomic specialist at all but that's my best advice. </li>
<li>Perhaps the reason my week has gone so well is that I took the advice of my friend <a href="http://justaddcode.com/blog">Neil</a> and took some breaks from standing. His specific advice was to sit down and eat lunch. I also sat down at a chair for a few minutes once or twice each day.</li>
<li><strong>Pair programming at a standing desk is great!</strong> It makes for very fast and fluid changes between programmers at the keyboard. You can just take a few steps and get out of the way when your co-worker is ready to write some code. Obviously your co-worker has to be on board with the whole concept of standing though.</li>
<li>I've felt more tired this week. However, I've been doing all kinds of other crazy stuff with the family this week (e.g. long day at the Minnesota State Fair and a late night at a MN Twins game). I can't really say I know what kind of effect the desk has had on me this week. I may never really know until much later, as I never seem to have a regular day or week in my life!</li>
</ul>
