title: "Browser-Based Piano Roll Sequencer UI"
---

<p>I started working on an HTML&amp;J implementation of a "piano roll" style UI for a sequencer:</p>
<p><a href="/hodsmedia/Untitled.png"><img src="/hodsmedia/Untitled.png" alt="UI Sample" title="UI Sample" width="707" height="498" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1112" /></a></p>
<p>For those of you with any software-based musical composition experience then this type of UI might look slightly familiar. It's a simple grid where you can draw notes and have them snap to specific rows/columns.</p>
<p>Once I get this baked enough, I'll move on to actually wiring this up to a real oscillator.</p>
<p>The code is available on GitHub. Hopefully this will evolve into a cool musical app: <a href="https://github.com/kindohm/techno-browser">https://github.com/kindohm/techno-browser</a></p>
