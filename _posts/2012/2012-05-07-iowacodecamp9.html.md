title: "Iowa Code Camp 9"
---

<p>This past weekend I was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for  <a href="http://iowacodecamp.com">Iowa Code Camp</a>. This event was their ninth one, and it was great!</p>



<p>I had the fortune of doing a presentation at the event on building an HTML5 audio player with <a href="http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/">buzz.js</a> and  <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">knockout.js</a>. If you attended my presentation and are looking for the content and code that I showed, you can get it all here:  <a href="https://github.com/kindohm/icc9-html5audioplayer"> github.com/kindohm/icc9-html5audioplayer</a>. Heck, even if you didn't attend my presentation you can still take a peek!</p>



<p>I should also mention that there were plenty of llamas in my  presentation content. Full size, all the way:</p>

<p>The event was great, and I thought this tweet really summed up  one of the reasons why: </p>

<p>Brent is absolutely right! Code camps are free and full of great technical content. I think one of the reasons for this is that us programmers want to come out and talk code for no other reason than because we love doing it. Nobody gets paid to speak - so you're  getting speakers that want to be there on their own pure motivation to share cool stuff and their own knowledge and experiences.</p>



<p><a href="http://twincitiescodecamp">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> is no exception - so if the Twin Cities is a better location for you make sure you subscribe to the RSS feed on the TCCC web site for info on the next TCCC event. <a href="http://twitter.com/tccodecamp"> @TCCodeCamp</a> is on Twitter too. </p>



<p>Our next Twin Cities Code Camp date will probably be sometime in October.</p>



<p>But don't let location restrict you... folks from as far away as <strong>Idaho</strong> attended this last Iowa Code Camp!</p>
