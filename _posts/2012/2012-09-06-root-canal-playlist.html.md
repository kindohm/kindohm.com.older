title: "Root Canal Playlist"
---

<p>I had a root canal done on short notice today, and the doctor let me listen to some tunes with headphones while they did their thing. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Here is the Root Canal Playlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antibiotics, by Digitalism</li>
<li>Iwywaw, by Com Truise</li>
<li>Solution (Dubsidia Remix), by Dead C.A.T Bounce</li>
<li>I Love You, by Modeselektor</li>
<li>Kill Bill Vol. 4, by Modeselektor</li>
<li>Intuition (Dubsidia Remix), by Melleefresh</li>
<li>Rotary, by Ellen Allien &amp; Apparat</li>
<li>BTTLS, by Battles</li>
<li>Road to Hell, by Sleigh Bells</li>
<li>Evil Twin, by Modeselektor</li>
<li>The Black Block, by Modeselektor</li>
</ul>
<p>Think I have a little bit of Modeselektor in my library?</p>
