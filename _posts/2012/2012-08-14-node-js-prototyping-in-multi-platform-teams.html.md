title: "Node.js prototyping in multi-platform teams"
---

<p>On my current project, we have three main products (a.k.a. sub-projects) being developed for our overall system. Our two main technology stacks are .NET (for desktop development) and Java (back ends accessed via HTTP). The developers on all these products work closely together each day, but needless to say we do not necessarily all speak the same programming language.</p>
<p>Our three products are all about to integrate with an additional 3rd-party product (also accessed over HTTP). After a period of researching this 3rd-party product we felt that it would be useful to implement a real working prototype to prove out our design and to prove that the product would work how we expected.</p>
<p>Admittedly, our prototyping process wasn't as planned and orchestrated as the below description will lead you to believe, but I think this description captures the spirit of what we were doing.</p>
<p>The main goal was to have a working prototype that would run on each developer's machine with minimal set up. Having experience with the programming language of choice was not too important.</p>
<p>What are the options for implementing this prototype?</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement it in C#. This is great for the .NET developers, but not so great for the Java developers who aren't familiar with .NET and/or don't have a .NET environment ready to go.</li>
<li>Implement it in Java. This is great for the Java devs, but not so great for the .NET devs who aren't familiar with Java and/or don't have a Java environment ready to go.</li>
<li>Implement it in something else (Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>As the title of this post implies we went with JavaScript. Some immediate benefits of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't speak for <em>all</em> environments equally since I don't have experience with all of them, but setting up a Node.js environment on Windows and non-Windows is trivial. Contrast this with a Ruby environment, where I feel like I am constantly banging my head against a wall.</li>
<li>Everyone on the team has web development experience and JavaScript was a familiar language.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, we had a few "servers" and "clients" written in JavaScript and we had real communication with our 3rd party product. It certainly met the main goal of quickly running a working prototype on any developer's machine. Each component of the prototype works perfectly on Windows and non-Windows machines with Node.js. Since we are all web developers, the JavaScript code was perfect to obtain an understanding of how integration with the 3rd-party product will work. </p>
<p>While inspecting the prototype code, I realized how nice the Node.js libraries worked for our prototype. We had a lot of HTTP communication and Url parsing to do in our prototype, and Node.js fits the bill perfectly for that.</p>
<p>Node.js and JavaScript aren't necessarily going to work for all prototypes. My intention here isn't to sell Node.js and JavaScript and convince you that they will solve all your problems. Because of our unique mixture of developer skills and the type of prototype we needed to build, Node.js and JavaScript worked perfectly.</p>
