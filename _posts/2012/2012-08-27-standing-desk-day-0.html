title: "Standing Desk: Day 0"
---

<p>Last week I was motivated by <a href="http://blog.donnfelker.com/2012/07/23/ikea-standing-desk-two-weeks-later/">Donn Felker's post</a> to build a standing desk from <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">$22-worth of Ikea furniture and parts</a>. I'm expecting a bit of pain this week! My goal this week is to just stick with it.</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="/hodsmedia/standing-desk-0-r1.jpg"><img src="/hodsmedia/standing-desk-0-r1.jpg" alt="" title="standing-desk-0-r" width="600" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1238" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/hodsmedia/standing-desk-1-r1.jpg"><img src="/hodsmedia/standing-desk-1-r1.jpg" alt="" title="standing-desk-1-r" width="600" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" /></a></p>
<p>As you may notice, my laptop is currently <em>underneath</em> the side table. That's temporary...  assuming this all goes well I plan on buying another table to support a 2nd monitor.</p>
<p>I didn't really modify the design at all, except that I chose to off-set the shelf to the right so that there is more room on my right side for the mouse. By centering the shelf on the brackets, the available space on the right side for my mousing hand just wasn't enough.</p>
