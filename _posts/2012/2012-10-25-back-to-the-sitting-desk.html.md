title: "Back to the Sitting Desk"

<p><img src="/hodsmedia/IMG_0278.jpg" alt="sitting" title="Sitting Desk" width="300" height="225" class="pull-right" />After two months of <a href="http://kindohm.com/blog/2012/08/31/standing-desk-one-week-later/">using a standing desk at work</a>, I'm back to sitting. All my co-workers are asking me: "tired of sitting, huh Mike?". This was more of a calculated change to my work environment experiment than it was a reaction to any dislike of the desk. I like to make changes and observe differences. I may go back to standing. But here are some things I have noticed over the past two months while standing:</p>
<h3>The Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>My back and neck felt better than ever.</li>
<li>Sitting never felt better at the end of the day.</li>
<li>Other evidence for why standing is better than sitting: <a href="http://ergonomics.about.com/od/office/a/Benefits-of-a-Standing-Desk.htm">ergonomics.about.com/od/office/a/Benefits-of-a-Standing-Desk.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Not So Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>My legs, specifically my calves, were sore every day (my feet were never tired).</li>
<li>I absolutely hated doing video conferencing, especially long 30-60 minute meetings, while standing. This was the worst part.</li>
<li>I need to sit while I eat lunch, and didn't like un-jacking myself from the internet (or work) while eating away from my desk.</li>
<li>My $20 standing-desk started to show its value after a while. I wished I had a desk dedicated to standing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise to using a standing desk as a software developer is that I didn't even notice that I was standing most of the time. Writing code felt natural. I imagine that this is because it is an engaging activity where you "get in the zone". While in the zone, developers have virtual blinders that shut out the rest of the world for a while.</p>
<p>Like I said, I may go back to the standing desk. Going back to sitting is another experiment. I've already noticed this week that my neck is sore, and I'm curious what else I will observe.</p>
