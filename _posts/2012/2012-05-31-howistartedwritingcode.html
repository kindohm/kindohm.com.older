title: "How I Started Writing Code"
---

<p>I was inspired to write this post after reading Scott Hanselman's post: <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SheLetMeTakeTheComputerHomeHowDidYouGetStartedInComputersAndProgramming.aspx">She let me take the computer home - how did you get started in computers and programming?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>"I can't imagine a life without telling a computer what to do"</p></blockquote>
<h3>The Early Years</h3>
<p>My first exposure to computers (that I remember) was in elementary school around 3rd grade (c. 1984). I have no idea what they were... PC's of some sort. I recall games like Math Blaster, Oregon Trail, and Artillery.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1989 when I did my first Apple BASIC programming in an 8th grade computer class. I remember writing simple programs that played tones through the speaker and writing some simple melodies. I also remember being protective of my 5-inch floppy disks, as prankster classmates enjoyed bringing magnets into the classroom and erasing others' disks with a wave of their hand. So, so cruel!</p>
<p>But that's not really what got me interested in programming...</p>
<h3>High School</h3>
<p>In high school (c. 1990), my family bought a 386 PC running Windows 3.1. It was a 16 Mhz CPU with a 80 MB hard drive. It even had a "Turbo" switch on the front that would toggle the CPU speed between 8 Mhz and 16 Mhz! I kept the 16 Mhz toggled on at all times. I liked to live fast back then.</p>
<p>I spent a LOT of time on that 386. While I didn't know a thing about writing software, nor did I know much about how the computer functioned, I was very comfortable around PC's in high school.</p>
<h3>College, Linux, and MUDs</h3>
<p>Then came college, my first experiences with Linux and Bash, and <em><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">Multi-User Dungeons (a.k.a. MUDs)</a></strong></em>. I was a good student in college, but MUDs were a big time-sink for me. I was playing on <a href="http://3k.org">3 Kingdoms</a> every spare minute I could find.</p>
<p>I honed my keyboarding skills and became a very fast typer by playing MUDs. My classmates always had me type up class and lab reports as they dictated.</p>
<p>I took a Fortran class my freshman year in 1994 (a pre-requisite for my Industrial Engineering studies) but I didn't find it too interesting.</p>
<p>It wasn't until about 1996 or so that I really, <em>really</em> got interested in writing code. This was due to two things: writing custom code for MUDs and HTML.</p>
<h3>Coding for MUDs</h3>
<p>MUDs are huge, virtual worlds created by programmers. I wanted to be one of the few who got to create one of these worlds. I was able to find other MUDders who were starting up their own MUD servers and convinced them to let me be a "Wizard" on their MUD and write code for it. Wizards had the ability to store and compile source files and make creative additions to the virtual MUD world. Environments, rooms, armor, weapons, monsters, treasure... it was all a part of building and creating, and it all required code.</p>
<p>I didn't even know what language I was using! I believe it was C or a C-like language. Having no formal programming education or training, I mimicked other people's code to get my creations to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>I learned through hands-on experience. No books. I just wrote code until things made sense.</p>
<p>I was absolutely hooked on code at this point. The ability to create something vast and original from nothing other than my own brain was a huge rush.</p>
<h3>HTML and the Web</h3>
<p>In 1996, the web was beginning to flourish and I wanted to be a part of it. Every student at the <a href="http://d.umn.edu">University of Minnesota Duluth</a> got their own directory on the school's public web server. I became very curious about how to create web pages and how HTML worked.</p>
<p>My friends Dave and Chris took me under their wing. They knew HTML and they taught me everything they knew. Sometimes I feel like I owe everything to them for teaching me those basics.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1997 I volunteered to be the web master for UMD's Industrial Engineering department. I built the core pages, typed all the content, took pictures of the department facilities, took pictures of faculty and staff, and built a full web site for the department. It wasn't designed very well, but it was a new experience and it was exciting. It took a lot of time to maintain, but I took pride in being "the guy" that built the internet face of the IE web site.</p>
<p>The site exists today, but not in the form that I originally built it in: <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/mie/">http://www.d.umn.edu/mie/</a>.</p>
<h3>The Rest is History</h3>
<p>From that point on, I tried to soak in as much about code as I could. I bought books on Java, C++, and Visual Basic. I wrote apps in my spare time. I couldn't stop learning.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was doing classic ASP, VB6, and SQL Server development for United Parcel Service almost immediately after graduating from college in 1998. Yes, an Industrial Engineering graduate doing business software development out of college.</p>
<p>The rest was certainly history after that point. I. Could. Not. Put. Code. Down.</p>
<p>After thinking about the path behind me, it is clear that what got me hooked on code was that it is about <em>creating</em> and <em>building</em>. I wasn't the greatest with mechanics or electronics, but code made sense to me and it allowed me to build and create just as easily.</p>
<p>...and I still can't put code down! I can't imagine a life without telling a computer what to do!</p>
