title: "The Eat-Less-Exercise-More Diet"
---

<p>I'm not sure what is driving me to write this post, other than I am so happy with the first success I've ever had with losing weight in my entire life.</p>
<p>This summer I've taken on the Eat-Less-Exercise-More diet and am down about 10 pounds [1].</p>
<p>For whatever reason, my desire to lose weight and shed fat this summer really took hold and I decided to seize my motivation and do something about it. When the pounds started melting off I couldn't believe it. I've never lost weight ever in my life and it was amazing to see a difference on the scale. I'm just barely noticing a difference in the mirror now.</p>
<p>What I'm thrilled about is that for the first time in my life I actually know what it takes, and what it feels like, to lose weight. This is probably a little different for everybody, but in my case it has been this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat mostly plants (mostly, not exclusively).</li>
<li>Eat less.</li>
<li>Feel hungry.</li>
<li>Snacks are fine. Refer to the above bullets.</li>
<li>Exercise a lot. Every other day, or every third day. For me, this is a vigorous 10-mile bike ride (about 45 minutes). Push yourself. Make it hard.</li>
<li>Avoid regular soda. Completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exercise is not a problem. I love riding my bike.</p>
<p>The hard part is that it takes big time discipline for me to eat right, and to not eat too much. I constantly crave carbs for snacks and I don't always feel like eating veggies. I always want to clean my plate at dinner. I don't like the feeling of being hungry. There have been weeks where I've slipped, but like I said, now I know what the good habits <em>feel</em> like. When I was slipping, I really knew it rather than just guessing or fooling myself. Feeling hungry. Knowing what to eat. Knowing how much exercise to do. Finally knowing what it takes is so awesome.</p>
<p>If I have an opinion at all coming out of this, it's that you shouldn't have to count calories or look at the nutrition information on a box to determine what you should eat. You should know by naming the food, and your body will help tell you too. Broccoli. Zucchini. Beef. Apples. Carrots. Rice. Oatmeal. These are good. Other questions you can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it come out of the ground? </li>
<li>How many ingredients are in it?</li>
<li>How much manufacturing do you think was required to put the food in that box?</li>
<li>Can you find this food name in a dictionary?</li>
<li>What is actually in that sandwich? No, I mean really.</li>
<li>Is it gooey?</li>
</ul>
<p>All you need is a little common sense. If you are looking at labels then you are just playing numbers games. Make grocery shopping simple and buy simple foods. Then don't eat too much of them and bike your ass off! (<a href="http://kindohm.com/blog/2012/08/02/not-a-good-bike-ride/">Just don't crash...</a>)</p>

<p>[1] I'm currently at 175.5 and weighed 186 earlier this spring. According to various BMI calculators, 165 is more of an ideal weight for me. Last year I was at 190 but was able to trim off a bit after I started getting off my butt and playing hockey.</p>
