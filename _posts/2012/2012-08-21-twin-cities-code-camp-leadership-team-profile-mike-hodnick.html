title: "Twin Cities Code Camp Leadership Team Profile: Mike Hodnick"
---

<p>It's not <em>all</em> about me - just this one post! In this last installment of Twin Cities Code Camp leadership team profiles, <a href="http://debuggerdotbreak.wordpress.com/author/judahgabriel/">Judah Himango</a> has supplied me with a list of questions to answer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Describe yourself in one sentence. No run-ons.</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm an independent software contractor in the Twin Cities who enjoys working on fringe technologies, playing hockey, and occasionally riding bikes off of bridges.</p>
<p><strong><em>You've recently worked on cloud apps, NUI, audio libs, and more. Where are you headed next?</em></strong></p>
<p>That is a tough question, as a lot of my deep dives into technology suddenly come out of nowhere (e.g. when a new library or technology is released). At a practical level I intend to keep building on current and emerging web-based technologies and skills. Targeting the web for multiple device types and form factors is a theme I'd like to run with right now. If mobile versions of Webkit, Mozilla, or IE eventually support an audio API, then things will get really interesting for me!</p>
<p><strong><em>Why should people care about Code Camp?</em></strong></p>
<p>People should care about code camp because it keeps the developer community strong, it arguably has the best technical content that a conference-type event can provide, and it is completely free. The community's participation keeps it free. A healthy developer community fosters the skills and knowledge that the region needs. Without code camp there would be very little cross-pollination of perspectives and information among developers, and that would just be bad.</p>
<p><strong><em>You were recently usurped by Mr. Himango as King of All Llama. Plans to reclaim your throne?</em></strong></p>
<p>This is most unfortunate. After years of free rein on all things llama, I grew complacent. The gauntlet has been thrown down, Mr. Himango. You will find yourself in your place among the alpacas soon enough.</p>
<p><strong><em>You jump into a time machine and fast forward 20 years. What does software look like?</em></strong></p>
<p>Hrm, I guess I look at this two ways: from the user's perspective and from the developer's perspective. From the user's perspective I think software will creep in to more corners of our lives. Apps and services will be everywhere. Your phone, tablet, car, TV, wristband, goggles, shirt, and pants, and screens in places such as stores and hotels will all share your data and make apps and services available to you. Because of today's young generations and their expectation to communicate quickly and share constantly, we will have a revolution of privacy concerns. Maybe in twenty years the privacy revolution will already be over.</p>
<p>As for developers, I think we will see classic object-oriented programming as we know it today fade away. Developers will demand more dynamic development with accessible tooling. Web apps, the HTTP protocol, and HTML will have been maxed-out beyond their usefulness and a new standard will have emerged.</p>
<p><strong><em>Impress us with a palindrome or haiku.</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>sometimes the llamas
are much more than you can take
but no, not this time</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>How do you keep your skills relevant given the constant stream of new technologies?</em></strong></p>
<p>First I try to latch on to something that is really cool (e.g. audio synthesis in a web browser). Then I try and apply something underneath that technology at the same time (e.g. JavaScript inheritance). I end up learning a few things at the same time. It takes more time, but latching on to something that is so bizarre or fun at first is the key for me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wat?</em></strong></p>
<p><code>¯\(°_o)/¯</code></p>
<p><strong><em>Best programming advice you've received?</em></strong></p>
<p>Draw a picture first before you write the first line (Tom Buettner, United Parcel Service, 1998).</p>
<p><strong><em>Tell us some coding music to listen to that will improve our productivity 10x.</em></strong></p>
<p>Oh man, where to start. Lately I've been listening to BT's <em>Laptop Symphony</em>. It's about 20 tracks of some of the biggest clichés in electronic music today but it is so fun to listen to. That's the big one for me right now. I'd also recommend these:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keelhaul II</em> by Keelhaul</li>
<li><em>Happy Birthday</em> by Modeselektor</li>
<li>All of Current Value's and Limewax's EP's</li>
<li><em>The Abduction of Barry</em> by Eight Frozen Modules</li>
<li><em>Tomorrow Does Not Exist</em> by I Broke My Robot</li>
</ul>
