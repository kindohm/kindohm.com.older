---

<p>Twin Cities Code Camp #13 is this weekend at the University of Minnesota! Have you registered yet? If not, you can do so at <a href="http://tccc13.eventbrite.com/">http://tccc13.eventbrite.com/</a>. The event is <strong>free</strong> and will have <em>thirty five</em> sessions of code-related content on topics ranging from Javascript to MongoDB to Windows 8 to responsive web design to Hadoop.</p>
<p>Twin Cities Code Camp (and code camps in general) is one of the best ways to enrich your software development skills and network with other programmers. It is an event made by the local software development community, which includes you! The content is driven by the community's own passion for programming. You will learn about technologies and practices that are relevant and meaningful to software development today. Plus you can hang out with other like-minded geeks and get to know a few friends!</p>
<p>If you are attending this next event, please refer to <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">twincitiescodecamp.com</a> to find an electronic copy (PDF) of the event's details and schedule. We are minimizing the use of paper at this event and are encouraging folks to use their phones and tablets to view the event information on the day of the event. If a paper copy is more your style, we will have limited paper copies available, but you can also print out your own copy from home before the event. We will place the final electronic copy on the site as soon as the session schedule and event details are finalized.</p>
<p>You can get all of the details about the event at <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">twincitiescodecamp.com</a>, including speakers, session information, and the schedule.</p>
<p>And most importantly, did you know that the Twin Cities Code Camp even has its own theme song?</p>
