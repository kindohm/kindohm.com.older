title: "Twin Cities Code Camp Leadership Team Profile: Jason Bock"
---

<p>In the third installment of the Twin Cities Code Camp leadership team profiles we have Jason Bock. Without Jason, there would be no TCCC. He planted the seed, watered it, spread some fertilizer, pulled weeds, chased away coyotes, and drove a tractor across the fertile fields of software development to bring you the best technical event in the region. All farming references aside, Jason has been the backbone of the event since its inception seven years ago.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who are you?</strong></em></p>
<p>Jason Bock</p>
<p><em><strong>Why is TCCC a great event to you?</strong></em></p>
<p>It's an informal gathering of developers to talk about what developers love to talk about: code. And it's free, how can you beat that? (Well, I guess you could give attendees money to attend, but I don't think we'll be doing that...)</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like most about being a part of the TCCC leadership team?</strong></em></p>
<p>There's a lot of things, but one that comes to mind is to see the session ideas come in each time we do an event. I love to see the diversity of topics, and it's exciting to me to see developers willing to share their hard-won knowledge to others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Llamas or Alpacas?</strong></em></p>
<p>Neutral</p>
<p><em><strong>As a programmer, what is you technology comfort zone (what do you typically work with)?</strong></em></p>
<p>Typically I'm in the Windows/.NET stack, though I'd have no problems moving to other technologies. I was on a iPhone POC a while back for a month and it was fun learing about technologies I had never worked with before.</p>
<p><em><strong>What language or technology is completely outside of your comfort zone that you would like to learn?</strong></em></p>
<p>It would be fun to be on a project that used a language I have never used before, like Erlang, F#, Ruby, etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is a hidden gem of programming that you think every programmer should know about, but most don't?</strong></em></p>
<p>Project Roslyn, especially if you're in the .NET world. I think this compiler API is going to open up a lot of possibilities for .NET developers in the near future, especially with code analysis and refactoring.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you contribute to any open source projects?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, you can see all of them here: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/jasonrbock#projects">http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/jasonrbock#projects</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Second try: llamas or alpacas?</strong></em></p>
<p>Still neutral</p>
<p><em><strong>Ten years ago, did you see yourself doing what you are doing now?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes and no. I love software development and I really don't ever see myself changing industries, so the fact that I still program on a day to day basis isn't suprising. Did I think I'd still be working for the same company (Magenic) 10 years down the road? No, because I had the mentality that you needed to switch employers every 1-2 years. I've been with Magenic for 11 years now, and that is something I wouldn't have guessed, but I'm very happy with my employer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why does a mouse when it spins?</strong></em></p>
<p>Because the lower the redder.</p>
