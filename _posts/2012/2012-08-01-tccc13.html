---

<p>The next Twin Cities Code Camp will be held on October 6th and 7th at the University of Minnesota in the Keller Hall building. You can register for the event at  <a href="http://tccc13.eventbrite.com">tccc13.eventbrite.com</a>. Some additional details about the event are available at <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com">twincitiescodecamp.com</a>. More details such as the schedule will become available after all session abstracts have been collected.</p>
<h3>The Event is Free!</h3>
<p>One of the most important parts of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/trobbins/archive/2004/12/12/280181.aspx">Code Camp Manifesto</a> is that code camps are free. Not only are they free, but code camps attract some of the best speakers and content from the region. The speakers are doing it because of their own passion for their topics. As a result, you get very high quality content about development topics from real developers...  all for free! </p>
<p>In addition, we supply breakfast and have outstanding prize drawings each day. Thanks to our donors and sponsors,  we've been able to provide some nifty prizes like LCD TV's and XBox 360 game consoles.</p>
<h3>Call for Speakers</h3>
<p>If you want to speak at the event, please submit a topic! Send a title, description, and short bio to <a href="mailto:tccodecamp@gmail.com">tccodecamp@gmail.com</a>. Your topic can be about almost anything, as long as there is code involved. In the recent past we've had sessions on  C#, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Windows 8, Ruby on Rails, iOS, CoffeeScript, Mongo DB, SQL Server, Android,  artificial intelligence, Windows Phone 7, HTML/CSS, and Git (to name a few). </p>
<h3>Donations and Sponsors</h3>

<h3>No Distance is Too Far!</h3>
<p>Our audience and speakers travel from Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas to attend the event.  If you've ever paid your own way to travel to a paid conference, consider coming to TCCC! It's a two-day, free event with outstanding content and a great audience to network with!</p>
<p>Hope to see you on October 6th!</p>
