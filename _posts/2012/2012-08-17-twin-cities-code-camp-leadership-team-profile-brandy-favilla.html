title: "Twin Cities Code Camp Leadership Team Profile: Brandy Favilla"
---

<p>Next in the series of Twin Cities Code Camp leadership team interviews is Brandy Favilla. Brandy has been with TCCC since the beginning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Who are you?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, I’m Brandy Favilla, a marketing and learning development professional dedicated to helping people and organizations achieve their goals.  I have a passion for blending people, process and technology together to gain competitive edge and reach organizational and personal objectives.  Recently I have been doing consulting work, mentoring dislocated workers in achieving their career goals by working with them to develop a personal marketing plan to highlight their skills and accomplishments to make an impact with their next employer.  I also do a lot of volunteer work with my son's school and athletic programs as well as volunteer work with a couple of other non profit organizations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why is TCCC a great event to you?</em></strong></p>
<p>I enjoy being a part of Twin Cities Code Camp because there is such a dynamic community of talented developers here in Minneapolis and there is so much energy and enthusiasm for knowledge sharing and helping others become better that couldn’t be accomplished as well without this amazing event.  Truth be told, I’m a wanna be developer and I enjoy being around this amazing community of professionals in hopes of being like them all some day!  =)</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you like most about being a part of the TCCC leadership team?</em></strong></p>
<p>I still remember when Jason first approached me about working with him and bringing code camp to the Twin Cities area many years ago.  Since that time, we have had so many successful and engaging events that I can’t imagine not being a part of the leadership team and helping to make the event better each season.  We have an amazing pool of talented speakers and such a dynamic and generous support system with our sponsors that I continue to be amazed that we have grown so much.  The leadership team has some great synergy between the members, and although we have had several come and go throughout the years during their career journey, it’s a wonderful group that we have in place now and you better watch out for the greatness we are bringing to the upcoming events!</p>
<p><strong><em>Llamas or Alpacas?</em></strong></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong><em>You're not a programmer any more, but how do you work with technology or with programmers?</em></strong></p>
<p>I don’t do any programming now or in the past several years, but in my former life as an instructor at Benchmark Learning, I was an instructor who taught a variety of applications and yes, some programming courses for web design.  Now, I work primarily with Office technology, social media platforms and teaching people how to leverage technology to improve productivity and take advantage of the networking opportunities that are out there in this virtual world.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the most interesting technology-related information or topic you've learned about at TCCC over the years?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, I suppose since I’ve never really sat many of the technology related topics over the years (OK, none of them), I would say that I really enjoyed the session about teaching programming to children that was done by Scott Davis and his son, Tommy.  I was blown away by not only his technical ability but his courage and ease in presenting and the strong bond that has been developed between them because of their passion for creativity and developing.  The world better watch out because that Tommy Davis is going to do amazing things!</p>
<p><strong><em>Are you involved in other areas of the technology community aside from TCCC?</em></strong></p>
<p>I am a past president and 5 year board member for PACT (Professional Association of Computer Trainers) and I am the web developer/communications person for the Coon Rapids Traveling Basketball association.</p>
<p><strong><em>Second try: llamas or alpacas?</em></strong></p>
<p>Um, I have no clue what an alpaca is and don’t feel like Googling it!</p>
<p><strong><em>Ten years ago, did you see yourself doing what you are doing now?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes and no.  I’ve always had a passion for community engagement and making a difference in the lives of others, so in that respect I have been fortunate enough to have positions that have allowed me to do this… did I see myself as unemployed and perhaps starting my own consulting business?  No, but it’s an exciting time to start Career Coaching and helping others achieve their goals.  I am still looking for full time employment so if you are hiring, call me!  =)</p>
<p><strong><em>Why does a mouse when it spins?</em></strong></p>
<p>Oh Mike, you come up with the strangest questions!  That’s what I love about you though!  You tell me the answer to this one!</p>
