title: "The Saga Continues: Back to the Standing Desk"

<p><a href="/hodsmedia/stand.jpg"><img class="pull-right" title="standing desk" src="/hodsmedia/stand.jpg" alt="standing desk" width="300" /></a> This morning I've switched back to the standing desk.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://kindohm.com/blog/2012/10/25/back-to-the-sitting-desk/">going back to a sitting desk</a> about a week ago, I couldn't take it any more. Whether it was a bad chair, bad posture, or just sitting in general, my entire back just hurt too much. The worst was my ass. I've never experienced this kind of pain before with sitting. I either really got used to standing or I developed some new slouching habits after going back to sitting.</p>

<p>I started this whole standing desk experiment <a href="http://kindohm.com/blog/2012/08/31/standing-desk-one-week-later/">back in August 2012</a>. Right now I can't imagine going back to sitting.</p>

<p><a href="http://kindohm.com/blog/2012/10/25/back-to-the-sitting-desk/">A week ago</a> I mentioned some of the things I disliked about the standing desk. One of the things I liked the least was standing up for longer video conference meetings. If I can find a place to sit for those meetings then things should work out well.</p>
