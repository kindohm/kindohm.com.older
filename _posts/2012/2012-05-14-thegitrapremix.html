title: "The Git Rap (+ remix)"

<blockquote><p>"just a touch that file .gitignore"</p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, a GitHub user by the name of Marak created a repo and posted tracks for a song he wrote and recorded called <a href="https://github.com/Marak/The-Git-Rap">The Git Rap</a>. He posted not only a final mix but the instrumental and vocal tracks as well. Basically it is a repo of wav files.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but do something with it...</p>
<p>After a week of slicing, copying, pasting, and turning knobs on synthesizers, I'm pleased to share with you The Git Rap - Kindohm Cherry-Pick Mix:</p>

<p>Marak accepted my pull request to the repo a few days ago, and the remix is now a permanent part of the repo! I may make another remix...we'll see.</p>
