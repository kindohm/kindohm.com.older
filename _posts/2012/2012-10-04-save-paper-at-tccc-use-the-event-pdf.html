<p>For this weekend's <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> at the University of Minnesota, we are limiting the number of paper copies of the event schedule and event details. If you have a smart phone or tablet, please use your device to download and/or view the online PDF version of the schedule and other event details. You can find the PDF here: <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2012/TCCC13Booklet.pdf">twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2012/TCCC13Booklet.pdf</a></p>

<p>We also have an HTML view of the schedule: <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2012/Schedule.aspx">twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2012/Schedule.aspx</a></p>

<p>If you do not have a smart phone or tablet, or if you prefer a printed copy, please plan on printing out your own copy before you arrive at the event.</p>
