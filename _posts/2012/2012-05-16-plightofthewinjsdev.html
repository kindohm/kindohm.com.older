title: "Plight of the Open Source Windows JavaScript Developer"
---

<p>If you are a Windows developer and want to contribute to open source JavaScript projects, prepare for a little bit of pain and suffering.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Why the pain and suffering?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Why? Because the Linux and Mac kids are having all the fun right now. They took the initiative and you have to follow in their footsteps. They aren't using Windows tooling (duh!). They are developing their own tooling on <code>node.js</code> or using tools that depend on <code>bash</code>.</p>
<p>Most Windows devs don't have much exposure to <code>node.js</code>, let alone <code>bash</code>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"What tooling are you talking about?"</p></blockquote>
<p>The most Windows-unfriendly tooling is the combination of <strong><code>Make</code></strong> and <strong><code>node.js</code> libraries</strong>. Separately they are not a problem on Windows, but it isn't so easy (or even possible) to get them to work together on Windows.</p>
<p>The good open source JavaScript projects out there <em>do not</em> use this combination and instead only depend on <code>node.js</code>. However there are still projects out there that use this combination.</p>
<p>In the Linux and Mac world, <code>Make</code> typically runs <code>bash</code> commands to do things like file system manipulation, run tests, and concatenate your JavaScript files. The problem is that Windows can't run <code>bash</code> commands.</p>
<p>One solution is to run <strong>Cygwin</strong> - which is a Unix emulator for Windows that will run <code>bash</code>. For vanilla <code>Make</code> tasks, this will work just fine. However this becomes a problem when you want to run <code>node.js</code> commands from a <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Whoa whoa whoa... can you back up and explain node.js a little?"</p></blockquote>
<p>In the JavaScript developer world, <code>node.js</code> is exploding. <code>node.js</code> is a JavaScript runtime that abstracts away system details so you can focus on writing JavaScript apps for your system. For the .NET devs out there, think of it this way: <code>node.js</code> is to JavaScript as the .NET Framework is to C#.</p>
<p>The best JavaScript tooling is being built on top of <code>node.js</code>. Take for example two popular <code>node.js</code> libraries: <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt">grunt</a>. UglifyJS is <em>arguably the fastest and most valid JavaScript minifier in existence today</em>. Many JavaScript projects are using it. Grunt is "a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects". Use Grunt to structure your JavaScript projects and carry out Make-like build tasks. These two libraries are run in the <code>node.js</code> runtime.</p>
<p>These two libraries are just a taste. There are <a href="http://search.npmjs.org/#/_browse/all">hundreds of JavaScript libraries built on <code>node.js</code></a> that make your own JavaScript development more productive.</p>
<p>I should mention that <code>node.js</code> installs and runs on Windows just fine. You can even alias it in PowerShell.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Ok, so what's the problem with Cygwin and node.js?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Some open source JavaScript projects use a combination of <em>both</em> <code>Make</code> and <code>node.js</code>. For example, they use <code>Make</code> to fire off UglifyJS minification. On Windows, this would mean you'd need to get <code>node.js</code> running on Cygwin. However, if you want to try and get <code>node.js</code> running on Cygwin, you are in for a world of hurt: <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-(Windows)"> github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-(Windows)</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put, <code>node.js</code> isn't going to be supported by Joyent to run on Cygwin anytime soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>"So I should get to know node.js on Windows, and for a new JavaScript project I should use <strong>only</strong> node.js libraries for build and dev tasks. Easy enough."</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep.</p>
<blockquote><p>"But since I develop on Windows I can't contribute to projects that depend on both Make and node.js?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Because we're talking about open source, <strong>the answer is no!!!</strong></p>
<p>The real task at hand is to eliminate the dependency on <code>Make</code> and to roll with 100% <code>node.js</code> tooling for JavaScript projects. Grunt does what <code>Make</code> was already doing in JavaScript builds, so eliminate the dependency on <code>Make</code>.</p>
<p>Leverage the fact that this is <em>open source</em>. Contribute to projects to help eliminate the <code>bash</code> and <code>Make</code> dependencies. The owners of the projects will most likely be delighted that someone is willing to contribute and improve the code base; that has at least been my experience with open source projects.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Wow, that doesn't sound too painful."</p></blockquote>
<p>It isn't, but it's a different world for the average Windows .NET developer who spends most of their time in Visual Studio. If you don't have much experience working from a command line then prepare for a different learning curve. Unless you want to dig in <em>deep</em> and spend a lot of extra time developing some plugins, you are going to get your hands dirty in the command line with <code>node.js</code>. In my opinion, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>For straight-up JavaScript development, big IDE's aren't going to give you much. JavaScript doesn't use a compiler. There is no need for Solution, Project, Resource, or UI meta-files. Keeping it real with the command line and a good text editor are what it's about with JavaScript. However, arguing about a programmer's preference in editors is like religious warfare. The bottom line is to use what makes you most productive, whether that's Notepad, Notepad++, Notepad2, Vim on Windows, or an IDE like Visual Studio [1].</p>
<p>If you are a Windows JavaScript developer, or a Windows developer at all for that matter, get to know <code>node.js</code> on Windows. Install it and start using it. Develop for it. It is how JavaScript development on Windows should be done, especially if it is for an open source project. It levels the playing field for JavaScript development across all of the main operating systems.</p>
<p style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 20px;">[1] Personally I have fun using <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a></code> to host a <code>Vim</code> editor and additional console prompts to run builds and tests. You never leave the keyboard and it's faster than Alt+Tab'ing since it's only one Window. However, <code>tmux</code> is not supported in Cygwin, so you need to dev on a Linux or Mac machine to go this route. Yet another pain for the Windows developer...if you want to go the <code>tmux</code> route.</p>
