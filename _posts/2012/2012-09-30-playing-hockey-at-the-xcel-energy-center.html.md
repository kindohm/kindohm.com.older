title: "Playing Hockey at the Xcel Energy Center"
---

<p>I had the good fortune of playing a game of pick-up hockey at the Xcel Energy Center yesterday!</p>
<p>What was it like? Most surprisingly, it didn't feel as large as when we've been to Wild games. The best part was the ice - perfectly hard, crisp, and smooth.</p>
