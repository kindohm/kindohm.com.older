<p>Halo 4, released earlier on November 6th, 2012 this week, requires <strong>8 GB</strong> of free drive space in order to use the multiplayer features. Scratch that... it requires 8 GB of free space in order to play <em>anything other than the campaign</em>. Don't believe me?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At a minimum, youâ€™ll need at least an 8GB USB Flash Drive or an Xbox 360 Hard Drive to play Multiplayer mode in Halo 4. For an optimal experience playing with an Xbox 360 Hard Drive is highly recommended. For Xbox 360 4GB, Arcade and Core consoles, the Xbox 360 Hard Drive is sold separately.</p>

<p>So what just happened here?</p>



<p>Halo 4 includes a second installation disk in the package. This second disk is used to install to the XBox hard drive (or a flash drive) all of the non-campaign features, such as multiplayer matchmaking (a.k.a. War Games), Spartan Ops, and the Forge. In order to use these features, you <em>must</em> install them because they cannot be played only from the game disk.</p>



<p>I didn't think much of this requirement after buying the game and immediately rushing home to play. Multiplayer was the first thing I wanted to try. I also have a 240 GB hard drive on my XBox with about 220 of free space. The used 20 GB is probably coming from Kinect Adventures as it takes timed pictures of the players during the game - a feature which I think is really awful and does nothing but eat up disk space. <em>Nobody</em> wants to keep those pictures. But I digress. The point is that I had the luxury of a big XBox 360 hard drive with plenty of space.</p>



<p>Since Nov. 6th, I've chatted with two friends who have been enthusiastic Halo gamers in the past about this 8 GB disk space requirement. One has a 2 GB drive, with obviously no space to spare. The other Looks at the Halo game as a very steep price tag and this disk space requirement could be a problem, and a deterrent, from buying the game for himself. Now he'll need to shell out another $10 or more for a decent flash drive. There are a handful of other friends and family who have 2 GB systems and who have played Halo multiplayer casually in the past.  Will they buy the game if they can no longer do so? How much <em>more</em> frustrated will they be if they buy the game and then find they can't use half of it?</p>



<p>I think that Microsoft and 343 Industries is going to make a large fraction of the Halo gamer community unhappy with this new requirement for Halo 4. They should have included a free 8 GB flash drive with the game so that <em>everyone</em> could play multiplayer right out of the gate. Instead, less-technical folks are going to be scratching their heads wondering why they can't get the multiplayer features to work with their smaller systems, or they will need to spend another $10 - $50 for a flash drive or a 360 hard drive. That's at least a $70 investment kids... probably more.</p>



<p>Is this the direction that platform gaming is going? Is the game media getting so large that you can't possibly use traditional game disks to host the content any more? I can sort of understand - the cinematics in Halo 4 are pretty amazing and I imagine they take up a lot of space on the disk. But why require an actuall <em>install</em>? Why not just require a 2nd disk to be inserted for multiplayer, and the first disk for campaign? I think Halo 4 is setting an interesting precedent (unless there are other games that do this already that I've just not heard of). If this is where things are headed, then I think console/platform games are going to be reserved for the die-hards and elite gamers. The casual gamer might as well stick to their phones.</p>
