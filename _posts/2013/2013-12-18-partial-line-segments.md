title: "New Music: Partial Line Segments"
---

Since 2009 I've been producing and accumulating a number of mixes that I have
never really shared or put anywhere. That ends today! 

I present to you: _Partial Line Segments_.

Partial Line Segments is a collection of electronic-based tunes. For the most
part, they are a mix of garage drum-n-bass and spacey breakcore. 

As I mentioned, the age of these tunes varies. Some of them were produced
back in 2009 (Meet My Amoeba and Feel the Sealant), and others as recently as 
2013 (Ignore File).

Hope you enjoy.
