<p>Twin Cities Code Camp #15 is less than a week away on Saturday, October 19th! Some reminders before the big day:</p>

<p><strong>Parking: </strong><br /> Be prepared to pay cash for parking (up to $10). Sometimes other events are going on at the U of M campus and the ramps may only accept cash on those days. We do not have control over whether the U chooses to accept only cash on the day of Twin Cities Code Camp. Also, the Washington avenue ramp tends to get very full - so please consider other parking options and walking a small distance to help distribute the volume of vehicles. A map of parking locations can be found here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xdxvQ#1">http://imgur.com/a/xdxvQ#1</a></p>

<p><strong>Check In: </strong><br /> Please allocate some time to check in. We typically see long lines in the minutes leading up to the first presentations. This weekend we will be improving our check-in and breakfast setup so that things move more quickly. You do NOT have to check in before attending any sessions, but be sure to check in before 11:45 AM so that you are entered into the prize drawing at the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Breakfast: </strong><br /> Assorted pastries and coffee will be available in the morning before the start of the opening remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Classroom Locations: </strong><br /> Sessions are held in the Keller and Rapson buildings. You will need to walk outside to get between the two buildings. We will have a limited number of map images available for attendees, but we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the locations of Keller and Rapson on the U of M campus beforehand. You can view maps of the campus and the code camp buildings here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xdxvQ#0">http://imgur.com/a/xdxvQ#0</a></p>

<p><strong>Lunch:</strong><br /> Lunch is not provided. However, keep your eye out for an event sponsor that we are working with who will provide lunch for event attendees onsite (pizza buffet, first come first serve until it is gone). We are working out the details and will have further information available that morning. Otherwise, there are a number of restaurants on Washington avenue for a quick lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Dress comfortably: </strong><br /> We have little control over the air conditioning in Keller Hall. The rooms can get a little hot and stuffy, so please dress appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media:</strong><br /> Use the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tccc15&amp;f=realtime">#tccc15</a> hashtag on Twitter to keep up with what is happening before, during, and after the event. The official Twin Cities Code Camp Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/TCCodeCamp">@tccodecamp</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless: </strong><br /> The U of M offers free guest wifi on campus, but a reliable connection is not guaranteed. More information on the U of M's wifi access: <a href="http://www.oit.umn.edu/wireless/index.htm">http://www.oit.umn.edu/wireless/index.htm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Prizes:</strong><br /> We will have a prize drawing at the end of the day. Your name will be included in the prize drawing ONLY if you check in by 11:45 AM. If your name is drawn, you MUST be present to win.</p>
<p>See you at the event!</p>
