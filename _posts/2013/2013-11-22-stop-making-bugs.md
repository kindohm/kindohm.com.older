<blockquote>"If I could give everybody one piece of advice,
if everybody would just do this one thing,
it would be great, and that is: please stop making bugs."</blockquote>

<p>-- Douglas Crockford: <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/397/panel-what-do-web-developers-need-to-know-in-2014-hanselman-crockford-papa-jacobs">http://hanselminutes.com/397/panel-what-do-web-developers-need-to-know-in-2014-hanselman-crockford-papa-jacobs</a></p>

<p>The audience and the panel laugh when Crockford says this, but I think he's dead serious.</p>

<p>In Crockford's two recent podcasts with Scott Hanselman (<a href="http://hanselminutes.com/396/bugs-considered-harmful-with-douglas-crockford">Bugs Considered Harmful</a> and <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/397/panel-what-do-web-developers-need-to-know-in-2014-hanselman-crockford-papa-jacobs">Panel: What to Web Developers need to know in 2013</a>), he emphasizes the need for disciplined coding, the importance of understanding the history of programming, and why these two things are important to write better code. It's great advice - especially in the midst of all kinds of crazy and cool things coming out in programming technology today. </p>
