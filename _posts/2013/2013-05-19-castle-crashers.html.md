<p>Today, Eva and I completed <a href="http://www.castlecrashers.com/">Castle
	Crashers</a>, a button-mashing horizontal-scrolling video game on
	XBox 360.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of gaming, this is no large feat. However, considering
	that we played this game for no more than an hour every one to
	four weeks, I think this is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Eva likes video games, but XBox and Wii time is not something that she craves.
	To her, video games are an activity to do with a friend, (usually) a parent,
	or (most often) dad. Given that, beating this game was a fun experience 
	over a long period of time that we did together!</p>

<p>Eva and I completing Castle Crashers reminded me of playing The Legend of 
Zelda with my dad back around 1990. My dad and I both beat The Legend of Zelda 
on the NES.	Zelda wasn't a co-op game, but we watched each other play and helped each
other out while trying to get through it. At the time, I didn't realize how cool
it was that my dad played video games - let alone conquer an epic and classic
game like Zelda. It was also a journey that we took together, solving puzzles
and beating the game together.</p>

<p>I certainly don't claim to have all of the video game fun with Eva. My wife
	has her mother-daughter gaming time too, usually helping Eva get through
	classic Mario games or Donkey Kong. And as a family, Wii Sports and 
	Mariokart Wii are big hits.</p>

<p>I think playing age-appropriate video games in small chunks of time
	as a family can be really fun. It makes for some great memories, and given the
	right game they can result in fun long-term challenges that you can
	solve together.</p>
