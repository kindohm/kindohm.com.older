<p>Among the additions and improvements to the game is an all-time leaderboard:</p>

<p>After your game has ended, you can now choose to submit your score with your name.</p>

<blockquote><em>"Why Oribtal Janitor? I liked Space Janitor better."</em></blockquote>

<p>Yeah, me too. Kind of. The problem was that spacejanitor.com was already taken,
  plus there is an online comedy show called "The Space Janitors". I know the game
  could probably stand on its own, but I decided to just change it and be done 
  with it.</p>

<blockquote><em>"Why version 0.3.2? What's with the funky version number?"</em></blockquote>

<p>The game isn't done yet. While it is fairly feature complete, there are a ton 
  of bugs to work out still. Version "1.0" implies a product that is polished
  and will be supported. In its current state, the game is neither polished nor
  will I provide any immediate support!</p>

<p>It is more important to me to get the game out into the wild and learn about
  all the bugs and problems than to keep developing it alone in my coding cave.</p>

<p>I have been working on a blog post and some screen casts on the sound design
  for the game. I thought it would be cool to show how the sounds were crafted.
  Stay tuned for that. Until then, play some games at  
  <a href="http://orbitaljanitor">orbitaljanitor.com</a> and see if you can get
on the leaderboard.</p>
