<p>I don't need to explain that working remotely or working from home is easier than ever before and that it is becoming more and more common. Despite how commonplace a remote workforce has become, many remote workers do not use communication tools appropriately or effectively while on the job. If you work remotely, you need to make sure you have the right tools to do it, are an expert in using them, and know what your employer's expectations are while you are remote.</p>
<h3>Fluently Use Video Conferencing Software</h3>
<p>Whether it is Skype, Google Hangouts, Oovoo, or Microsoft Lync, you <em>must</em> become completely fluent in the video conferencing software your employer uses. If your employer doesn't use these tools, then for the love of Pete why not? If you rely on a phone, you are doing it wrong. Phones are impractical tools in an age where video, app sharing, data sharing, and keyboard-intensive tasks are the norm.</p>
<p>If you've never used video conferencing software before, then it will be a slight learning curve. Make sure you know how to invite people to calls, share files, start and stop your audio and video feeds, schedule meetings with links to a video conference and configure your microphone, speakers, and camera. Nothing is worse than waiting for someone to show up to a video conference because they don't know how to get the software to work.</p>
<h3>Invest In a Good Microphone/Earphone Headset and Camera</h3>
<p>While doing video conferencing you will need to communicate with co-workers.  To do this you will need a good microphone and speakers (a.k.a. headphones), and possibly a video camera.</p>
<p><em>A good headset will allow you to be heard clearly</em> by your co-workers and you will be able to hear them more clearly too. </p>
<p>Do not just rely on your laptop's built-in microphone and speakers. It's always a challenge to hear someone who uses their built-in laptop mic. Usually the built-in microphones are low-quality, pick up a lot of ambient noise, and results in sounding like you are talking on a severely muffled telephone. Invest in a better microphone, and you might as well get a headset that includes a microphone and headphones together.</p>
<p>There is a large variety of products available. I personally prefer the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/6810?crid=36">Logitech H555</a> headset:</p>
<p><a href="/hodsmedia/logitech-laptop-headset-h555.png"><img src="/hodsmedia/logitech-laptop-headset-h555.png" alt="" title="logitech-laptop-headset-h555" width="455" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1503" /></a></p>
<p>The H555 is a USB-based headset that never fails for me. It has great audio quality.</p>
<p>You may optionally want to pick up a good camera (a.k.a. web cam). If your laptop has a built-in camera, then you can probably get by, but for $30 - $50 you can upgrade to a much better quality camera. With this your coworkers will have a better picture of you - which may or may not be important to you.</p>
<h3>Audio Etiquette</h3>
<p>First and foremost, mute yourself often. Be aware of how you are presenting yourself. The trade-off of using a good quality microphone that is located near your face is that it will pick up every little sound coming from your mouth. Trust me, nobody wants to hear any of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breathing</li>
<li>Swallowing</li>
<li>Drinking or chewing</li>
<li>Dog panting in the background</li>
<li>Wind blowing in the background</li>
<li>Sniffing</li>
<li>Scratching</li>
<li>Sounds of the microphone brushing against facial hair</li>
<li>Licking your lips</li>
<li>Any other wet, slippery, or sticky sound emerging from your mouth</li>
<li><em>Any noise at all other than your voice while speaking</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you know how to control the sounds you make, or train to  muting yourself often when you are not speaking. Most video conferencing software shows a microphone level monitor so that you can see how much noise you're making. If you see you're making noise but aren't talking, then mute yourself. Video conferencing software usually provides a mute button so that you can do it quickly and easily. Here's an example of what the Google Hangout mute button looks like, right in their top toolbar:</p>
<p><a href="/hodsmedia/hangoutmute.png"><img src="/hodsmedia/hangoutmute.png" alt="" title="hangoutmute" width="261" height="81" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507" /></a></p>
<h3>Video Etiquette</h3>
<p>Again, be aware of how you are presenting yourself on a video call. Remember that on a video call, your head is being shown on a big screen somewhere. Try to orient the camera so that it shows the right amount of your face, head, and body. Don't sit so close to the camera so that your face takes up most of the screen. Otherwise you will overwhelm your audience with a large set of facial features on their screens. Oh, and don't eat lunch on camera unless your co-workers give you the OK to do so.</p>
<h3>Expectations of Your Availability</h3>
<p>When you work remotely, everybody knows you're there sitting in front of the keyboard at home. Like it or not, your co-workers' expectation is that you are going to be available 100% of the time.</p>
<p>In a physical office, you can get away with ducking into a conference room to get away for some isolated work time, or walk over to co-worker's desk to chat about the weekend or meet about some real work. The point is that in a physical office you can get away. If someone sees you are not at your desk, they'll just wait and find you later. However, when you're working remotely, they <em>know</em> where you are and that you are there. </p>
<p>As a result, be prepared to have that headset on most of the day. You are going to <em>live</em> in your video conference software.</p>
<h3>Last Tidbits</h3>
<p>Working remotely is a great asset to both an employer and its employees. However, it requires a shift in how you work with others and requires you to be fluent with video conference software and tooling.</p>
