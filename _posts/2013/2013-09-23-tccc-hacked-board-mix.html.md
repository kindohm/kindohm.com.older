<p>A couple of years ago, I wrote and recorded the (unofficial) Twin Cities
    Code Camp Theme Song, with Jason Bock shredding on the guitar solo.</p>







<p>I decided to take the first verse of the vocal track, chop it up, and 
    produce a remix. I give to you, the <em>Twin Cities Code Camp Theme
    Song: Hacked Board Mix</em>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>







<p>I realize this track won't fit everyone's taste, but I wasn't going for
    popularity points here! This was more of a fun time with synths and
    a sample slicer than anything else!</p>







<p>Since this track barely resembles the original, you may be wondering what
    parts of the original are in this remix. The answer is the first lines
    of the verse:</p>







<blockquote><em>
    
<p>"If you're really into software development..."</p>






    
<p>"Twin Cities Code Camp!"</p>






</em></blockquote>

<p>The <em>"Twin Cities Code Camp"</em> part should be easy enough to pick out.
    The <em>first</em> line of the verse can be heard chopped up and higher
    pitched at 1:24 of the remix.</p>







<p>If you're interested in using the samples from this remix, you can get
them here: <a href="http://sdrv.ms/18TztoE">http://sdrv.ms/18TztoE</a>. Only
samples that I created with my own hands and little brain are available. That
big kick drum and snare drum... sorry, but those are licensed to me and not 
you!</p>







<p>And just for reference, the original tune:</p>
