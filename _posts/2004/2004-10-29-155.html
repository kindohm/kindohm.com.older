title: "Basement Project Update"

<P>I posted a some new images documenting my basement remodeling project.  Here are some of <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=90a3a530-6caf-45e5-a317-da62207b2816">finishing the fresh air intake vents</A> and some of <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=9457c1e7-c811-456f-930a-482a559ea40q">routing new coax and ethernet cable to the living room</A>.</P> <P><IMG src="images/air.jpg" alt="Where did the old air ducts go??" /></P> <P>I'm currently focusing on duct work.  That consists of adding new return vents to the rec room and soundproof room, replacing the soundproof room's supply vent with insulated ductwork, and adding a new supply vent to the bathroom area.</P> <P>After the ducts I'll be ready to start electrical work.  I think.  </P>
