I've posted a helpful website tool for download called the <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/WSFileHelper.aspx">Website File Helper</a>.&nbsp; If you are a webmaster or web developer, this tool may come in handy for you - especially if you work with big image libraries or other types of file libraries.&nbsp; It'll resize images, create thumbnails, and catalog a folder structure.&nbsp; Have fun.
