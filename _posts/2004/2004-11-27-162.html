<p>When I got up today, I took a few snapshots of what is allegedly the first snowfall of 2004.&nbsp; Not very much snow, and it will probably all melt today, but it looked great.&nbsp; These pictures were taken at about 7:00 a.m.&nbsp; To view all of them, <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=934ed337-3b91-4b89-9fa2-38350aed624c" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://www.kindohm.com/Gallery/First%20Snowfall%202004/PB270597.JPG" border="0" width="300" height="225" /></p> <p><img src="http://www.kindohm.com/Gallery/First%20Snowfall%202004/PB270596.JPG" border="0" width="300" height="225" /></p>
