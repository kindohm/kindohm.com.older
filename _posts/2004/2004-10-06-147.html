title: "Images and MP3&#39;s now hosted locally"
---

<P>The image gallery has been enhanced for much faster viewing.&nbsp; Images are now hosted locally on the site rather than a separate WSS server.&nbsp; Plus the way the image gallery presents itself is just faster too.</P> <P>MP3's in the music library are also hosted locally.&nbsp; I'm running low on disk space so the entire selection of Kindohm music isn't available yet - just the good stuff for now.</P>
