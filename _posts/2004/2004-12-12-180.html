title: "New CD Released - Calle Fabio Rufino"
---

<P>For all you Kindohm music fans - I've put out another CD entitled Calle Fabio Rufino.  It's something I've been working on since the summer, and this past week I finally got around to getting the artwork done (much thanks to Nicole) and assembling the disks and cases.  </P> <P><A href="http://www.kindohm.com/MusicFolder.aspx?FolderID=49240fa8-98c8-455c-a5fa-7d6fbb56aa88">Download all the mp3's here.</A></P> <P>Ask me for a CD if you're interested.  The artwork is excellent.  I should post a picture...  Anyway, I have 15 copies, so just let me know.</P>
