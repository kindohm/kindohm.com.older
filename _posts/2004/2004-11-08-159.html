title: "Northern Lights in MN"
---

<P>Anyone else see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_borealis" target="_blank">northern lights (a.k.a. Polar Aurorae)</a> last night on 11/7/2004?&nbsp; Living in Chaska, MN, I never thought I would have seen them after moving from Duluth.&nbsp; I'd always thought that the Chaska/Twin Cities area was too far south.&nbsp; But, they were very spectacular.&nbsp; </P> <P>I you saw them, I'd like to hear about it and where you saw them from - Minnesota or otherwise.</P>
