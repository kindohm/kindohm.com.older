<P>I just got back from playing a holiday concert at the Mall of America.&nbsp; What a waste of time.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; First, my fellow musicians and I have invested more than 6 hours of our personal time into rehearsals.&nbsp; Second, most of us made sacrifices to leave work on time in our holiday attire and get to the MOA 30 minutes before showtime.&nbsp; In an instant, our concert is cut short after 30 minutes because a few fools chose to throw some Tic-Tacs and pennies onto the band from the rotunda levels above us.&nbsp; Nobody was seriously hurt, but a few people actually ended up with some bruises.&nbsp; </P> <P>Our director made it clear in the weeks before that if anything was thrown on us, we would immediately leave.&nbsp; So we did.&nbsp; And we're never going back.&nbsp; I wasn't with <a href="http://www.medalistband.com" target="_blank">Medalist</a> last year, but I guess the same thing happened last year.&nbsp; Nice job MOA security, and nice job parents.&nbsp; </P>
