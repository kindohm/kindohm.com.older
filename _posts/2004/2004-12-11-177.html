title: "You&#39;ve played too much Halo 2 when..."
---

<P>Nicole and I were in Barnes and Noble last night doing some Christmas shopping.&nbsp; We were standing&nbsp;at the main entrance which is an open area with a few displays of holiday-oriented books.&nbsp;After standing in the open area for a few seconds, I did something I never imagined I'd do:&nbsp; I instinctively walked behind one of the taller displays so that it was between me and the main entrance and provided cover.&nbsp; </P> <P>I really don't think I play Halo 2 THAT much, but this is just weird.&nbsp; I mean, in real life am I going to start looking over my shoulder, listening for the &#8220;ping-ping-ping&#8221; of a thrown grenade, and pausing beside doorways before walking through them?&nbsp; I don't think it will ever come to that.&nbsp; I hope.</P> <P>I guess it could be worse.&nbsp; I could be looking for blinking question marks in the ceiling, mushrooms to squash, or collecting flashing coins in mid-air. </P>
