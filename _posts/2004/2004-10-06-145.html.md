title: "Yes - another website"

For the 3rd time in about 6 months, kindohm.com has gone through a major overhaul. I think I'm finally happy with how it has turned out. A great balance of content-management features (thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://scottwater.com/blog">.Text</a>), customized content, automatic organized navigation, and separation of style. Knowing me, I'll probably end up changing the site appearance every few months. And, knowing me, I'll re-architect the site again within the year :P
