title: "Easy Productivity Boost With MS Outlook"
---

<p>"What is this killer feature", you ask? "What's so cool that I can do in Outlook to make me more productive", you say? Is it the RSS feeds? No. Is it easier Task creation? No. Is it better integration with SharePoint? No. </p> <p>Here is how you can customize MS Outlook to boost your productivity:</p> <ol>     <li>Turn off email message notifications. This includes the envelope icon in your system tray, beeps and sounds, and <em>especially</em> the popup window that displays when new messages arrive. </li>     <li>Change your mail account settings to only check for new messages every few hours instead of every few minutes. Heck, even go for every four hours. </li>     <li>Scan your inbox and deal with only the important messages that really are important (e.g. the network is down, etc). Save the rest for later. </li>     <li>Every morning, empty your inbox. Respond to messages requiring your reply, and add tasks to your day for messages that require you to do something. Delete and archive <em>all</em> messages appropriately. </li>     <li>Extra credit: create a message filter that dumps all messages where you are NOT in the "To:" field to a folder named "CC" or "Copied". Arguably, since these messages aren't directed at you, you can assume they don't require your immediate attention and you can deal with them the next morning (see previous item). </li> </ol> <p>I've been using this system for about two weeks now, and I've been surprised at how much more productive I've been. I haven't measured my productivity in any way, but I know I've gotten more done. Because I've reduced the number of interruptions that Outlook causes, I can stay focused when I need to. My tasks get knocked out more quickly because I can stay in that super-developer zen state of mind for longer periods of time.</p> <p>Be careful with this system though. Your place of work may have an expectation that employees should respond immediately to all messages. If so, that's unfortunate, and unrealistic. You should only need to immediately respond to the messages that really <em>do</em> require immediate attention (emergencies, etc). If someone needs your attention urgently, that's what instant messaging is for :)</p> <p>Seriously, use your common sense and do what's right in your work environment. I think the chances are good that you can make some of these changes with Outlook (or any mail program) without most of your coworkers or customers knowing. Arguably, you'll be able to respond to their requests and needs more effectively by being able to focus on tasks better because of the reduced interruptions.</p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span><em>Disable all of your message alerts:</em></span><br /><a title="Photo Sharing" target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/406386512/"><img style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px" height="496" alt="DisableOutlookNotifications" width="375" border="0" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/406386512_dc0554bdaf.jpg" /></a>  </p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/outlook" target="_blank" rel="tag">outlook</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email" target="_blank" rel="tag">email</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/productivity" target="_blank" rel="tag">productivity</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/work" target="_blank" rel="tag">work</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/office" target="_blank" rel="tag">office</a> </p>
