title: "Beta Carnage"

<p>I went ahead and bought <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: line-through">the <a title="Halo" target="_blank" href="http://www.bungie.net">Halo</a> 3 Beta</span> Crackdown last night. Crackdown is an awesome game. The new weapons are pretty cool - especially the Spartan Laser. The matchmaking has some nicer features too in Crackdown, like telling you how many matching games it's finding for you, etc. Crackdown's film replay features are good - it's just fun to be able to replay your game, however I'm a little disappointed that there aren't more options for changing the film's point of view, etc. Of course, Crackdown is still in beta form so that may change come September 25th. Crackdown's graphics are definitely a little raw - I wasn't sure if I'd be able to tell a difference between a beta game and a final version. Things just don't look quite so polished. I think my favorite feature of Crackdown is the Vallhalla map. It's beautiful and the terrain makes for very, very fun games. I'd definitely recommend going out and buying Crackdown so that you can play it before its play-period expires in early June.</p>
