title: "Drug Test"
---

<p>I was required to take a drug test this week as a condition for the contract work I'm doing at a new client.  I've done a drug test before (pee in a cup) and it's always interesting to see how detailed and streamlined the test is.  Where I went, it wasn't as much of a doctor's or clinic office as much as it was a small space to efficiently process as many people as quickly as possible.  Only one tech was working there and she had everyone in and out pretty quickly.</p>  <p>One of the people there was a woman with a newborn baby girl.  The tech wouldn't let her in to take the test with the baby, and the mother was pretty pissed about it as she claimed that she had no idea she couldn't bring in a baby.  The tech was kind of rude to her by saying "who would have thought to bring a baby to a drug test"?  Heh, well, this woman did I guess.  Obviously the tech was right - the tech can't trust anybody, and for all we know the woman was going to try and have the baby pee in a cup for her.  I think the woman ended up just waiting for her husband to get there to watch the kid.  </p> <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/drugs" target="_blank" rel="tag">drugs</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/test" target="_blank" rel="tag">test</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pee" target="_blank" rel="tag">pee</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cup" target="_blank" rel="tag">cup</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/work" target="_blank" rel="tag">work</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/baby" target="_blank" rel="tag">baby</a> </p>
