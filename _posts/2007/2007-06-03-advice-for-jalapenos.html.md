title: "Advice for Jalapenos"
---

<p>Last night we went to <a href="http://www.jakescitygrille.com" target="_blank">Jake's</a> for dinner.  I ordered some outstanding enchiladas with a side of jalapenos.  Based on first-hand experience last night, I can say this about handling jalapenos with bare hands:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Do not handle jalapenos with your hands (use a fork or something)  </li>
<li>If you must use your hands, wash your hands immediately after  </li>
<li>Do not rub your eyes  </li>
<li>Do not rub your nose  </li>
<li>Be careful when going to the bathroom (men)</li></ul> 
<p>As you may guess, I used my bare hands to pick up my jalapenos.  While eating, for some reason I needed to rub my nose.  Holy crap - about five minutes later it felt like my nose was going to explode.  When I breathed it felt like fire.  I also rubbed my eye.  Oh, the burn.  And I won't say much about the bathroom experience except that more burning was involved.  Wash your hands <strong><em>before</em></strong> you go to the bathroom, my fellow men.  </p>
