<p>Last night <a href="http://medalistband.com" target="_blank">Medalist</a> played out at Buffalo High School in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=buffalo,+mn&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Buffalo, MN</a>.  Buffalo isn't a small town by any means (about 10,000 people), but it's not exactly close to the Twin Cities either.  In my experience, more rural schools have pretty minimal music programs.  With respect to percussion gear, those schools scrounge for any junky equipment they can get.  But with Buffalo, they have a gorgeous performing space and a lot of percussion gear in great condition.  I was surprised.  What was even better was that their concert band sounded outstanding.  In fact, their band had only rehearsed their material for a month before last night's concert.  Whatever the music educators in Buffalo are doing, it's a good thing.  </p>
