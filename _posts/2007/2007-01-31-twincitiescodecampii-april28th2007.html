title: "Twin Cities Code Camp II - April 28th 2007"
---

<p>The next Twin Cities Code Camp is on April 28th, 2007.  Visit <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com" target="_blank">www.twincitiescodecamp.com</a> for all the details.  </p>  <p>I'm actually going to present a topic this time: 3D Construction Basics in Windows Presentation Foundation.  That's assuming my topic gets approved :)</p>  <p>They're still looking for presenters, so if you want to give a talk go ahead and visit the site for information about how to submit a topic.  I didn't go to the last one but the event was a success last time and it looked like a lot of fun.</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/codecamp" target="_blank" rel="tag">codecamp</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/code" target="_blank" rel="tag">code</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/presentation" target="_blank" rel="tag">presentation</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wpf" target="_blank" rel="tag">wpf</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/3d" target="_blank" rel="tag">3d</a>  </p>
