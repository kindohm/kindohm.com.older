<p>You know it had to be done!</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.halo3basics.com">www.halo3basics.com</a></p> <p>The site is a compilation of basic strategies and tactics you can employ in Halo 3 multiplayer to get better at the game.  </p> <p>Now that Halo 3 through XBox live supports "saved films", I hope to include some video examples on the site some day in the future.  </p> <p>For those of you looking closely, Halo3Basics.com looks very similar to the old Halo2Basics.com (which no longer exists).  This is true, and in fact much of the content base from Halo2Basics was used for Halo3Basics.  Thanks to those who helped provide content suggestions for Halo2Basics.com - your credit is given on the new site (although I haven't finalized the list of folks who have helped out - please be patient).  </p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:61fb3165-dd54-443c-a496-cd1d991ac5bf" contenteditable="false">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/halo" target="_blank" rel="tag">halo</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/halo3" target="_blank" rel="tag">halo3</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="tag">multiplayer</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/tips" target="_blank" rel="tag">tips</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/strategies" target="_blank" rel="tag">strategies</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/xbox" target="_blank" rel="tag">xbox</a></div>
