I'm finding that there are plenty of departure and arrival times to satisfy my irregular waking and work habits (or lack thereof).  On any given day, I can pretty much come and go as I need to and a bus on my route will be there.  Before I started bussing I was concerned that I'd be constrained to only a few available departure times.  </p> <p>I discovered this morning that the cafe here at [client name] has fresh, warm muffins in the morning.  Sometimes I get a muffin at a Caribou store before coming to work, and they're usually old, dry, cold, and sometimes downright awful.  But this morning's muffin was the mother of all muffins.  Oh how tasty it was.  I began to wonder how muffins are acceptable breakfast food.  A muffin is just a cake that overflowed out of a wrapper.  You don't see people eating cake for breakfast very often.  Cake <strong><em>and</em></strong> ice cream for breakfast...  now that's a great idea waiting to happen.  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:5eeae1d1-3cbf-4a61-b683-23991095a60d" contenteditable="false">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/muffin" target="_blank" rel="tag">muffin</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/work" target="_blank" rel="tag">work</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/office" target="_blank" rel="tag">office</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bus" target="_blank" rel="tag">bus</a></div>
