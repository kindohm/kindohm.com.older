title: "The XBox Repair Saga - You have no registered devices (again)"
---

<p>Just when things were looking good, I log in to see if there's any new information on service.xbox.com and now I see this message:</p>
<pre><code>You have no registered devices.</code></pre>
<p>My tracking number that I came across yesterday still doesn't work on fedex.com. I know tracking numbers don't work immediately, but it's been about 24 hours. </p>
<p>Great. Microsoft suddenly decided that I <strong><em>don't</em></strong> have an XBox in their possession.  Or in route to my doorstep.  Completely different story than yesterday.  Nice job turkeys.  </p>
