title: "You guessed it - another Subtext skin"
---

<p>You knew it was coming.  I've skinned my site yet again.  This skin is code-named "Ely".  A dedication to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=ely,+mn&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=k&amp;z=14&amp;om=1" target="_blank">a town</a> near one of my favorite camping spots.  What a fixed-width font and small town on the edge of the boundary waters have in common is a mystery to me.  Let me know if you can think of a connection.  </p>
<p>For those keeping score, this one took about 3 hours to whip up.  I cheated and used my last skin as a starting point.  I also used tables for the layout because I'm lazy (? <a href="http://justaddcode.com/blog" target="_blank">Neil</a>).  I added the tag cloud over in the side bar too, for those of you who giggle with delight at eye candy.  </p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
