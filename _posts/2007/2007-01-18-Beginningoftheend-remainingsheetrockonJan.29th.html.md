title: "Beginning of the end - remaining sheetrock on Jan. 29th"
---

<p>I just set up a date (1/29/2007) with my sheetrock contractor to begin the drywall work in the rest of our basement.  This is sweet.  We'll have a basement with walls in a few weeks.  I can hardly believe it.  Yesterday all I wanted to do was spend time in the studio because it was 1/3 done with sheetrock.  I'm pretty excited about this.  It's been a long, long time getting to this point and I can't wait for it to be done.</p>
