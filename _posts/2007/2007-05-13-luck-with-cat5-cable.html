title: "Luck with Cat5 Cable"
---

<p>Yesterday I finished terminating six Cat5 cable lines (including some internediate patching), so now the office, living room, and studio all have connectivity.  What's been surprising is that every connection has worked on the first try.  I've never had such great luck with running network cable before.  Now the XBox 360 is hooked up, the wireless access point has been moved to the main level, and I can upload music more easily.  I'll finish the rest of the cable in the basement living area once we're actually <em>living</em> down there.  </p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/networking" target="_blank" rel="tag">networking</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cat5" target="_blank" rel="tag">cat5</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cable" target="_blank" rel="tag">cable</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/house" target="_blank" rel="tag">house</a> </p>
