title: "The Elephant and Forge in Halo 3"
---

<p>I haven't really kept up with pre-launch <a title="Halo" target="_blank" href="http://www.bungie.net">Halo</a> 3 news lately, and today I came across two nuggets of H3 goodness:</p> <p>1. The Elephant. I don't know any specifics at all, other than a) it is a vehicle and 2) you can fit 16 players + some small vehicles in it. </p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="400" alt="" src="http://www.xboxfamily.com/Untitled/elephantgy4.jpg" /><br /> <em>The Elephant</em></p> <p>2. Forge. There will be a map "editor" called Forge. You can't actually design levels with it, but you can highly customize weapons, vehicles, and items within the maps. e.g. create a giant pile of fusion cores or something. </p> <p>I found both of these pieces of information in <a target="_blank" href="http://xboxfamilynews.blogspot.com/2007/08/halo-3-forge-details.html">this article</a>.</p>
