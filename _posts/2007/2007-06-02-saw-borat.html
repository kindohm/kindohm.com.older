title: "Saw Borat"
---

<p>Nikki and I watched Borat (for the first time) last night.  It was funnier when my friends and coworkers were reciting quotes from the movie.  It was ok.  Too much hype before seeing it, maybe.  We passed over The Departed and The Good Shepard because Borat was a lot shorter.  </p>  <p class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:74c9a7cc-e7f6-4d31-b2d0-37a80d97d8e7" contenteditable="false">tags: <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/borat" target="_blank" rel="tag">borat</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/movie" target="_blank" rel="tag">movie</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/humor" target="_blank" rel="tag">humor</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/hype" target="_blank" rel="tag">hype</a></p>
