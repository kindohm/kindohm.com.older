title: "DevConn Day 1 Wrap Up"
---

<p>I'm finding that the presentations aren't quite meeting all of my expectations out here at DevConn, although I think I've learned to weed out the less-interesting stuff based on the titles and short descriptions in the schedule.  </p> <p><strong>VMS306: A Lap Around Visual Studio Team System 2008</strong></p> <p>This session did not meet my expectations.  It was a run through of the basic features of VS TS 2008 - most of which are available in VS TS 2005.  Work items, reporting, source control, etc.  Ho hum.  </p> <p><strong>HMS308: Microsoft ASP .NET AJAX 1.0 and SharePoint</strong></p> <p>This session was worth the price of admission.  Mike Ammerlaan gave this talk and covered what you need to do in WSS/MOSS to get AJAX hooked up, how to make AJAX features useful/deployable in WSS, and also demonstrated some interesting ideas of what you could accomplish with respect to SharePoint.  Specifically, he demonstrated extending the out-of-the-box edit form of a list item by replacing a long, vertical form that had basic controls with a tabbed form that utilized sliders and other controls.  The AJAX magic to specifically implement the tabs and controls wasn't so cool as it was to see what he specifically chose to manipulate within WSS to make it happen.  </p> <p><strong>HMS310: Search in MOSS 2007: Customizing and Extending</strong></p> <p>Thomas Rizzo presented this one.  His content was accurate and he's a great speaker, but I personally didn't get much out of it.  It was a little higher level than I was hoping for.  He talked about what options are available in the SharePoint Search web parts to customize their appearance, walked through the search API, and wrote an app on the spot that used the API.  </p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:820723bd-0511-43dd-8623-cc34fcc2208f" contenteditable="false">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/devconnections" target="_blank" rel="tag">devconnections</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/sharepoint" target="_blank" rel="tag">sharepoint</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/conference" target="_blank" rel="tag">conference</a></div>
