title: "Carpet and Flooring in 48 hours"
---

<p>A guy from Empire came to our house today, and when he walked out we had signed a contract.  Our entire basement will have carpet/flooring by the end of the day on Wednesday.  Hopefully it'll turn out looking great when it's all done.  It's kind of weird moving this fast, but it's also pretty exciting to think we'll have something else besides bare concrete to walk on - in less than two days!</p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:1d177e37-8db5-4839-8468-2a817702518e" contenteditable="false">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/carpet" target="_blank" rel="tag">carpet</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/flooring" target="_blank" rel="tag">flooring</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/basement" target="_blank" rel="tag">basement</a></div>
