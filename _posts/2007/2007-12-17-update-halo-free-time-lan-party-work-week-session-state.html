I got a bug in me this weekend to try and unlock some of the unique armor in the game (for changing your multiplayer appearance).  Thus, I spent time collecting skulls, trying to do certain things in games (like running over someone with an ATV), and overall just playing as much as possible without getting bored.  That new shoulder piece will be <strong><em>so</em> </strong>worth it.  I'm sure of it.</p> <p>This was the first weekend in a while that I completely blew off pretty much everything.  There are a few software projects out there that I need to work on.  One is a javascript web app for a friend and the others are open-source projects that other folks are waiting for me on.  You know who you are.  Sorry.  Mental health and well being took priority this weekend :)</p> <p><a href="http://kindohm.com/localimages/posts/32e398850f22_8DB5/Picture47.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="184" alt="Picture 47" src="http://kindohm.com/localimages/posts/32e398850f22_8DB5/Picture47_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a> I want to host another LAN party at my house soon, but I've verbally committed to myself and Nikki that we'd finish our basement first.  Technically we could use the space now, but the networking isn't done and there's just a lot of crap to shift around to make space.  Plus there's no furniture yet.  </p> <p>This will be my last week at work until January.  I'm looking forward to eleven straight days off.  Until then, I need to figure out some serialization issues with SQL session state.  On the current project I'm on, all of my XML serialization tests pass with my business objects.  When I run a web page that uses Session state to persist them across page loads, it works fine.  However when I deployed the page to a SharePoint site that uses SQL session state, it blew up with some serialization exceptions.  Either I need to fix the serialization or not use Session state.  Either way, I was planning on being done with this feature by this time already.  </p> <p>Notable events from this past weekend that you should skip over:</p> <ul> <li>Got new tires for the car  </li><li>Got a new car battery  </li><li>Paid a hefty price for new car tires and battery  </li><li>Ate pasta</li></ul> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:1dca80ed-5300-4df4-a34a-ba3a45ed0e80">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/sql" target="_blank" rel="tag">sql</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/halo" target="_blank" rel="tag">halo</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/sharepoint" target="_blank" rel="tag">sharepoint</a></div>
