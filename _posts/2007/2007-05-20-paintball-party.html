<p>Yesterday it was <a href="http://www.iwkid.com" target="_blank">Raymond's</a> bachelor party and we went over to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=hudson,+wi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Hudson</a> to play <a href="http://www.stcroixpaintball.com" target="_blank">paintball</a>.  I think there were about 10 of us, and it was a blast.  Of course this morning I'm sore as hell and am dotted with purple spots.  I got hit in the chest a few times and I now clearly have three nipples on the left side.  </p>  <p>This place had two courses and they were fairly small compared to what I've played on before.  However that made it kind of fun because you could see pretty much everything that was going on the whole time and the games went fast.</p>  <p>Thanks to <a title="Raymond" href="http://iwkid.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Raymond</a> and his brother for organizing the whole thing!</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/paintball" target="_blank" rel="tag">paintball</a>  </p>
