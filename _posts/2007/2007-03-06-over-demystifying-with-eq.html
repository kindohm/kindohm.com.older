title: "Over-demystifying with EQ"
---

<p>This article, <a href="http://www.methodshop.com/gadgets/tutorials/ituneseq/index.shtml" target="_blank">Demystifying the iTunes EQ</a>, gets a little bit technical about equalization and explains to non-audiophiles how to use it to tweak the music playing through iTunes.  Most, if not all, audio players (such as WMP, Winamp, etc) have this equalization capability.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, the article rubs me the wrong way a little bit.  It's partially because I produce my own music, and partially because I'm just weird - so don't listen to me.  Messing with the EQ while listening to music is like looking at a painting through tinted glasses.  Even worse, it can be like adding your own brush strokes or spilling a can of paint.  Somehow I think that messing with the EQ is a discredit to the original producer of the music you're listening to.  Producers, mixers, and "masterers" already take care of the EQ for you when they are working on an artist's song before it makes it to the final album (or single).  My point is not that I give a damn about the producer's career or livelyhood.  But the song as-is is a work of art in its own right.  Why blemish it?  </p>  <p>The other thing about the article is that I really disagree with its description of some of the frequency ranges.  Kick drums at 32 Hz?  The nasal quality at 2kHz?  Mixing and equalization is a very subjective thing, but 2kHz is well above the "nasal" range if you ask me.  Perhaps the author and I just disagree about how to describe those frequency ranges.  </p>  <p>Now, one thing I DO agree with (a little bit) is tweaking your EQ to compensate for a lousy pair of headphones or speakers.  e.g. I really like the rubber, push-in ear buds that have a lot of low end.  If I'm wearing headphones that are not "buds" but instead sit off of my ear a bit - I'll probably boost the lower frequencies a bit.  </p>  <p>What I can't stand are the "presets".  Jazz, classical, rock, etc.  I've never understood this.  This is where the professionals have already mixed the music appropriately for their specific genres.  e.g. a Jazz mixer has already thought of this and has mixed the tune appropriately for jazz instrumentation (probably).  Why would you go with some preset when a pro has tweaked and trimmed the final mix for you?  </p>  <p>Bottom line - go with what sounds best to you.  I just enjoy the art of mixing and producing quite a bit and want to hear the subtleties of those musical processes come through my music player and headphones.</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/music" target="_blank" rel="tag">music</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/eq" target="_blank" rel="tag">eq</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/equalization" target="_blank" rel="tag">equalization</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/mp3" target="_blank" rel="tag">mp3</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/audio" target="_blank" rel="tag">audio</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/mixing" target="_blank" rel="tag">mixing</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/production" target="_blank" rel="tag">production</a> </p>
