title: "Complex ModelVisual3D Composition and Hit Testing in WPF"
---

<p>I posted a new article last night on how to handle complex model interaction in WPF 3D: <a title="http://www.kindohm.com/technical/ComplexVisuals.htm" href="http://www.kindohm.com/technical/ComplexVisuals.htm">http://www.kindohm.com/technical/ComplexVisuals.htm</a></p>
<p>I also added a new <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/technical/toc.htm" target="_blank">table of contents page</a> since the number of articles is growing.  </p>
  
<p>I feel a little bad that Google adsense is all over those articles, but I can't deny that the ads help pay for keeping kindohm.com up and running.</p>
