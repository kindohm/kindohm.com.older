title: "Halo 3 Pre-Launch Party"
---

<p>Last night was a Halo 3 pre-launch party at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=microsoft&amp;near=bloomington,+mn&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.852165,-93.351989&amp;spn=0.00613,0.009924&amp;t=k&amp;z=17&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Microsoft office in Bloomington</a>.  <a href="http://jasonbock.net" target="_blank">Jason</a> invited me, and he also allowed me to bring along one other person, so I invited <a href="http://www.iwkid.com" target="_blank">Raymond</a> to come too.  There were six consoles going all at once, each with 4-person games going on.  There were more people than there were controllers (maybe 75 people?), but folks were really good about getting up after a game and letting other people play.  They handed out some gifts (t-shirts, hats, posters) and provided food and drinkies.  </p>
<p>They also organized a Slayer tournament, and somehow I managed to get 3rd place.  I don't know how many people in total played in the tournament - maybe 40?  I'm sure I wasn't the 3rd-best player.  I just got lucky with the Gravity Hammer in the 2nd round :)  There were a lot of "kids" there last night (children of Microsoft employees, etc), and after the first two rounds there were a couple of dads who came up to me and said "Hey!  You beat my kid!".  All in good fun of course.  It was fun.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the game?  Well, Halo 3 multiplayer is <em>still</em> Halo multiplayer.  But there are enough new goodies baked in to the game now that will keep players interested for a long time.  New maps, vehicles, weapons and creative use of items like the bubble shields and trip mines keep the game fresh.  I didn't get a chance to play around with Forge or saved films, but I didn't expect to in such a large group of attendees.  </p>
<p>The best map?  I only played a handful: High Ground, Snowbound, Epitaph, Last Resort, Isolation, and one that I think was called "Narrows".  For Slayer, I thought Epitaph was great.  Kind of a small/medium size with the hammer in the middle and rocket goodness hidden high up.  </p>
<p>The beast weapon?  There is no best weapon, but I'm an immediate fan of the dual-wielded Spikers for some reason.  I just can't get the hang of the Spartan Laser.  Otherwise, if you can find the assault rifle in combination with the battle rifle and a supply of grenades, you can win any game.  </p>
<p>Here's to the new (and last) era of the Halo games!</p>
