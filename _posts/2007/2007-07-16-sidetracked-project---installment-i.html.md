title: "Sidetracked Project - Installment I"
---

<p><a href="http://www.sidetrackedproject.net/SP/InstallmentOne/InstallmentOne.html" target="_blank">Installment I of the Sidetracked Project is complete</a>.  This is the result of a two-year effort by me and <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net" target="_blank">Jason</a>.  Available for download are all of the mp3s, a liner notes PDF, and m3u playlists for both my and Jason's preferred listening order.  </p>
<p>Our music leans toward the heavier end of the musical spectrum, in case you don't know what to expect.  My favorite three tunes we worked on are Revenge of the Pinatas, The Missionary Song, and Empyrion.  However there is plenty of other great music, including some very, very serious (&lt;/sarcasm&gt;) stuff.  </p>
