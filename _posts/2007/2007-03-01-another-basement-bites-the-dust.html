title: "Another Basement Bites the Dust"
---

<p>Last night I got all of the drywall dust vacuumed up in our basement.  The biggest benefit is that now the cats won't track around the dust anymore after they decide to visit the basement.  We can start painting now too which is pretty exciting.</p>  <p>In preparation for painting I estimated the wall square footage (about 1500 SF) so that I can buy the right amount of primer.  I also decided to measure the floor area, since a lot of people ask me how large our basement is.  I always say "about 1000 SF", but I was surprised to find that it was more like 550 SF.  The reaosn I've always said 1000 is because the other two levels of our house equal around 2000 SF.  I figured since we're adding a 3rd level of space, it'd be another 1000.  Wrong wrong wrong.  I think the catch is that I only measured <em>finished</em> space, and didn't include areas like the storage room or under the stairs.  I estimate it'd be another 200 SF if I included those areas.  But still, 750 SF is still smaller than I expected.</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/basement" target="_blank" rel="tag">basement</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/vacuum" target="_blank" rel="tag">vacuum</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/dust" target="_blank" rel="tag">dust</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/drywall" target="_blank" rel="tag">drywall</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/paint" target="_blank" rel="tag">paint</a> </p>
