title: "Surprise Electrical Work"
---

<p>I got a call from the county electrical inspector saying that my electrical permit was expired.  He said unless I could finish my electrical work for him to do a final inspection on Monday morning that I'd have to renew (and pay $50) my permit.  </p>  <p>So, here I am this weekend finishing all of my electrical work instead of getting ready for painting.  Basically I've had to wire up all the outlets (23 of them), switches, light fixtures, and fans.  Yesterday I got all of the new circuit breakers and circuit hookups completed in the electrical box.  As of this morning I have 8 more outlets to go and need to put up all of the switch/outlet covers.</p>  <p>I've also had to figure out my double 5/8" sheetrock issue in the studio with respect to the outlets.  Outlets come with about a 1" screw on them so that you can install them on one layer of up to 5/8" sheetrock.  For my double layers, I had to pick up some 1.5" screws (2" for the ceiling fixtures).  I wasn't sure how it'd work but it ended up working great.</p>  <p>The positive side is that all of the electrical work is getting done - for good!  It's awesome because now there is light everywhere in the basement - something that I haven't ever had.  Working in the dark is lame, let me tell you.</p>  <p>So, I expect to finish the electrical work today and be ready for the final inspection tomorrow morning.  Next weekend we're out of town for my cousin Matt's wedding reception (he already had the ceremony in Vegas), so maybe we'll paint in two weeks - unless I can muster enough motivation after Eva goes to bed on the weeknights.  </p>  <p>I said muster.</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/electrical" target="_blank" rel="tag">electrical</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/work" target="_blank" rel="tag">work</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/basement" target="_blank" rel="tag">basement</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/inspection" target="_blank" rel="tag">inspection</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/house" target="_blank" rel="tag">house</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/homeimprovement" target="_blank" rel="tag">homeimprovement</a>  </p>
