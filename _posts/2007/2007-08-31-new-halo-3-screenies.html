title: "New Halo 3 Screenies"
---

<p>Some new screenshots from <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> 3 are available over at EW.com: <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20054031,00.html" target="_blank">EW.com: First Look: Halo 3</a>.</p>  <p><img src="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/070829/halo/08-22-07-02_l.jpg" /></p>  <p>Seems that every gaming publication now has an article titled "First Look: Halo 3".  Heh.  Anyway, these new screenies show off a little bit of the Elephant vehicle, the map "Shrine", and 4-player campaign co-op (with mention of campaign multiplayer scoring).  Included in the series of screenies are some older ones too that were available on b.net a while back.</p>
