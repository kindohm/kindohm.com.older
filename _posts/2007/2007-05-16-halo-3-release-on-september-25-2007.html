Nice.  I'll be letting my boss know right away that I'll be taking that day off :)  So let's see, that's about four months away.  Very cool.  The anticipation for H3 isn't nearly as big as it was for H2 - at least for me.  I remember back in 2004 searching and clawing for every news byte, screenshot, and tidbit I could find on H2.  Now I just try and watch the vidocs when they come out.  For now, I'll save all judgement, anxiety, and excitement for after I open the game box.</p>  <p>Our LAN parties don't happen as often as they used to, but I imagine that the number of people attending in the future will be smaller as we start playing <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> 3.  Not as many folks have XBox 360's yet.  I'm sure folks will make the purchase for Halo 3, but not all of them.  Online play has pretty much replaced the frequent LAN parties anyway. </p>  <p>Anyway, it's cool to finally see a release date.  When Bungie said "Fall 2007", I was thinking December.  I'm surprised that the actual date is on the beginning edge of "Fall".  </p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/halo" target="_blank" rel="tag">halo</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/game" target="_blank" rel="tag">game</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/xbox" target="_blank" rel="tag">xbox</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bungie" target="_blank" rel="tag">bungie</a>  </p>
