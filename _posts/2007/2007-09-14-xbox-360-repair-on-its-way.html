title: "xbox 360 repair on its way?"
---

<p>This morning I checked the XBox service site for my repair status and found that my status had changed to this:</p><pre><code>Repair Status: No pending repair</code></pre>
<p>Could it be on its way?  Unfortunately there wasn't a new tracking number displayed or anything, nor do I know if I'll be notified via email of a new tracking number or anything.  I may be in the dark from now on.  And hopefully their site is not lying to me either!</p> <p style="color: red;"><strong>Update</strong></p> <p>I knew they were lying!  I checked back and the repair status was back in its original state:</p>  <pre><code>Device: Xbox360 Hardware
Serial Number: XXXXXXXXXXXX
Warranty Status: In Warranty
Repair Status: Device Received at Service Center</code></pre>
