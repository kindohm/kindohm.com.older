title: "Eva&#39;s New Site"
---

<p>I moved Eva's site (<a href="http://www.evajoy.net">http://www.evajoy.net</a>) to a new location yesterday.  Basically it's just a blog hosted at blogger.com.  The old site wrapped the RSS feed in a new design.  Basically I had everything enclosed in a custom look and feel.  The down side is that features like an archive or comments weren't available through the custom design.  Plus there was a bunch of static content on the custom site that was becoming a pain to update.  So I decided to just move the entire domain over to blogger and use their design.  It'll make things easier.  </p> <p>I highly doubt any of you out there subscribe to her feed, but in case you do, you may want to update your subscription Url because it changed (and so did all the permalinks, for that matter).  Point your aggregator at <a href="http://www.evajoy.net">www.evajoy.net</a> and your app should be able to auto-discover the new feed.  </p>
