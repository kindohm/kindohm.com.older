title: "Finishing the paint job"
---

<p>Now that Jason and I are done with <a href="http://sidetrackedproject.net" target="_blank">our first installment of music</a> I've started tearing down the make-shift recording space we've been using for vocals in the basement.  Unfortunately the basement has been a catch-all space for a lot of other junk lately, and in general it's just a mess.  Today I tried to make a dent and empty it of all the crap and make it so that it will be easy to paint.  The "studio" is completely empty except for my drums.  This is a significant.  My drums have been left literally untouched for about two years in our storage room, and today they have been moved.  </p>
<p>Eva has never heard or even <em>seen</em> my drums... not good for a dad who hopes his daughter will enjoy playing an instrument some day.  Part of my motivation now for completing this basement project is so that Eva can see and play the instruments set up in the studio.  When I started this project, I never would have thought she would be more than two years old at its completion.  </p>
<p>I'm hoping that by the end of the weekend the basement will be in a state where we can just start painting.  After that, it's doors, flooring, trim, and bathroom fixtures.  We are so almost done.  </p>
