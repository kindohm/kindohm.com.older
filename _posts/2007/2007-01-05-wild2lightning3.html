Tampa isn't a great team this year but the Wild just played poorly. The guys tried really hard but sometimes their skill just doesn't match their heart. Heh, arguably their skill NEVER matches their heart :) </p> <p><a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=PlayerDetail&amp;playerId=8465026" target="_blank">Parrish</a> is really starting to pick up his offensive game. He got a goal last night which was a redirection from an outside shot - exactly his style of goal :) Nice an garbage-y. His former Jefferson coach will probably buy him a steak...</p> <p>The crowd was as loud as its ever been for a regular season game. The New Year's eve game was the same. Prior to new year's eve, the fans have seemed a bit quiet and bored for a while. I'm one of them. Honestly there just hasn't been much to cheer about until lately. They finally got a winning streak going, only to be broken last night.</p> <p><a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=PlayerDetail&amp;playerId=8468483" target="_blank">Gaborik</a> still isn't back. In my mind, he's turned out to be a bust for the Wild. He was their first ever draft choice, he has superstar skill, but he injures himself constantly. He's missed over 30 games, which is close to half the season. All because of a groin pull. Just like last year. And the year before. And other times... The Wild can't count on him to be healthy, and if we ever wanted to get rid of him, what other team would want him? I hope he proves me wrong and is forever healthy after he returns this season.</p> <p>What's up with the Northwest division this year? All five teams have the same record (give or take a few points). We've all exchanged first place a few times, and fallen to last place a few times. And I think it's even happened within a few weeks. Yesterday we were first in the division, and today we're third. Yesterday we would have been seeded third in the playoffs, now we'd be seeded eighth. They have to keep winning games.</p> <p>A new guy on our team at work played hockey with the Wild's <a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=PlayerDetail&amp;playerId=8458988" target="_blank">Manny Fernandez</a> while playing junior hockey in Montreal. It's awesome to have someone that loves hockey sitting by me - let alone someone who has played at the junior level and knows an NHL player. I'll probably learn a thing or two from him :)</p> <p></p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hockey" target="_blank" rel="tag">hockey</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/nhl" target="_blank" rel="tag">nhl</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wild" target="_blank" rel="tag">wild</a> </p>
