title: "That never happens (in Messenger)"

<p>I had my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/DebugView.mspx" target="_blank">DebugView</a> window open and noticed a strange message appear while my computer was basically idling:</p>

<pre><code>ThumbPosition got called! That never happens.</code></pre>
<p>Sweet. A developer somewhere has a sense of humor. So, where exactly did this debug message come from? Based on the proc ID in the debug window I found that it was Messenger:</p>

<p>Oh you silly MSFTies. This begs the question, what exactly is going on in Messenger that "never happens"?</p>
