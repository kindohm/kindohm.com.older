<p>I love his take.  I don't understand the suit concept either, and his comment about what you say and do making more of an impact than your clothes is so true.  I'm fortunate enough to work for a company where a suit or tie is not required.  We dress so that our customers are comfortable working with us.</p>
  
<p>I used to work in the industrial engineering department of United Parcel Service.  Every, and I mean every, non-union employee had to wear at least a tie (if you were a man) and you were required to wear a suit if you were "management" - which was a loose term for meaning that you had stock options and sold your soul to The Man.  Except for sales people, <em>no non-union employee</em> at UPS had contact with anybody outside of the company.  Why were we required to wear suits?  I have no idea.  Then again this is the same company that hired a photographer to take pictures of people's desks at night to make sure they had no more than two personal items on it [1].  At my exit interview I was asked what I thought about the suit policy, and I said that I didn't really understand it.  I didn't get much of a reply from that.  </p>
  
<p>I think most people and businesses out there follow Cuban's take.  I don't really know many people that wear suits to work.  Heck I can't even think of one person I know personally that does.  These days when I see someone in a suit, it's almost a little distracting.  </p>
  
<p>[1] Maybe times have changed there...  it was an extremely conservative workplace when I was there.  I hope it's changed.  I'd be interested to hear if it has.</p>
