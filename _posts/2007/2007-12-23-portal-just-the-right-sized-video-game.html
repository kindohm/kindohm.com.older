I played it in a single, 4-hour session yesterday while Eva took an unusually long nap.  If you've played Portal, then you already know how fun it is.  It's a 3D first-person puzzle solver with some fun physics and mental twisters.  Aside from that though, it is the perfect length game - at least for me.  I think if there were other games out there that were that fun and that short, I'd buy them all (assuming they were priced lower than your typical $60 XBox 360 game).  </p> <p>As for the the game itself, I thought it was great that the first 19 missions in Portal were just preparation for the <strong><em>rest</em></strong> of the game!  </p> <p>Just reading the line doesn't do justice without hearing it in the game, but my favorite GlaDOS quote during the game was this one:</p> <p><em>"Didn't we have some fun though? Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said 'Goodbye' and you were like (deep male voice) 'NO WAY!' (normal voice) and then I was all 'We pretended we were going to murder you'? That was great!"</em></p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:857280ee-67e0-4e9d-b34c-9f73db2c6ec3">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/portal" rel="tag" target="_blank">portal</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/game" rel="tag" target="_blank">game</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/xbox%20360" rel="tag" target="_blank">xbox 360</a></div>
