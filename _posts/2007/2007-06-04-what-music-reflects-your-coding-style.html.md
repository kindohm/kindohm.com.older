title: "What Music Reflects Your Coding Style?"
---

<p><a href="http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/05/i-would-rather-be-jazz-programmer.html" target="_blank">Ron Evan</a> and <a href="http://feeds.haacked.com/~r/haacked/~3/120999974/id-rather-be-a-dj-than-a-rockstar-developer.aspx" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a> posted fun and interesting takes on what style of music you reflect in your coding.  I don't know that I really have a musical genre that reflects my style, but here's what'd I'd pick:</p>
<p><strong>Electro Psychocountry Garage Revival</strong></p>
<ul> 
<li>Your applications have a twang</li> 
<li>Look like you just rolled out of bed as you write code</li> 
<li>Screw process, it's all about the code, man.</li> 
<li>Screw the code, it's all about whatever you feel like doing, man.</li> 
<li>You have groupies at your cubicle</li> 
<li>Every day, you begin writing code at 9:00 PM and end at 6:00 AM</li> 
<li>Your code is annoying and offensive to the masses, but you have a strong following of confused, angst-ridden adolescents.  </li></ul>
