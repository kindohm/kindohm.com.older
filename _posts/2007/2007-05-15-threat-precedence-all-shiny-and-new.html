title: "Threat Precedence All Shiny and New"

<p>If you downloaded <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/archive/2007/05/13/Threat-Precedence.aspx">Threat Precedence</a> earlier this week, please download it again :)  I discovered some very bad problems with the mix yesterday and just finished correcting them.  If you have an old copy, I encourage you to compare the old with the new and let me know what you think.  Specifically, the snare in the main break in the beginning of the tune had a lot of low-end attack, and under compression it made a very annoying low-end pop on its attack.  It bugged the hell out of me.  I also tweaked a few other issues to help make the arrangement a little less spazzy - without taking away from the overall aggressive tone, of course :)</p>  <p class="tags"> tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/music" target="_blank" rel="tag">music</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/electronica" target="_blank" rel="tag">electronica</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/audio" target="_blank" rel="tag">audio</a>  </p>
