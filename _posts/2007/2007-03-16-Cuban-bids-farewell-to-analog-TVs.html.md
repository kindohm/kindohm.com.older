<p><em>You missed it. It happened on March 1st and barely a word was written. No tears were shed. No pronouncements or prognostications about the future of TV. </em></p>
  
<p><em>As of March 1st, 2007, companies are restricted from importing analog TVs from foreign countries or trafficking in interstate commerce of analog sets. Bottom line, is that retailers of Analog only TVs aren't allowed to buy any more to sell. Analog TVs are now officially dead.</em></p>

<p>Like he said, I missed it.  Interesting stuff.</p>
