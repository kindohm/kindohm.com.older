title: "Basement Bathroom - Done"
---

<p>Nikki and I were furiously painting the bathroom all last week so that it'd be ready for getting our sink and toilet installed on Sunday.  We needed one coat of primer and four coats of paint to finally get it to look good.  </p> <p>My dad came over to help on Sunday and we finished the bathroom:</p> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/1181341503/" title="Photo Sharing"><img border="0" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1318/1181341503_93f43f803b_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="P8190057" /></a></p> <br /> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/1181341411/" title="Photo Sharing"><img border="0" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1259/1181341411_3bf10baac4_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="P8190056" /></a></p> <br /> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/1182200868/" title="Photo Sharing"><img border="0" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1304/1182200868_6701f14447_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="P8200059" /></a></p>  <p>While installing the toilet flange (underneath the toilet), we needed to hammer it down so that it fit flush with the floor.  However, we didn't want to hammer on it directly, so we looked around for a spare block of wood to set on the flange to hammer on.  There wasn't any spare lumber around, so we improvised and used this instead:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/1182200530/" title="Photo Sharing"><img border="0" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1057/1182200530_ee89048e85_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="P8190053" /></a></p>  <p>Nothing like hammering on a VB6 book :)</p>  <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:27b4f99a-655c-48d1-bc93-4ac3b7070cfd">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bathroom" rel="tag" target="_blank">bathroom</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/basement" rel="tag" target="_blank">basement</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/project" rel="tag" target="_blank">project</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/plumbing" rel="tag" target="_blank">plumbing</a></div>
