title: "Spring Drum"

<p><a href="http://justaddcode.com/blog" target="_blank">Neil</a> and I took a brief diversion after lunch and went over to <a href="http://www.grothmusic.com/" target="_blank">Groth Music</a> today.  Groth is a great because they carry a lot of other stuff than just mainstream gear (ala Guitar Center).  Anyway, I picked up a couple of egg shakers, and also one of these:</p>  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.remo.com/photo/catalog/6/24/629/big.jpg" /><br /><em>Spring Drum </em></p>  <p>It's a "spring drum", a.k.a "thunder drum".  I'd never seen these before.  The funny part was that I tried to flex my musicologist musicles and tried to convince Neil that it was a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuica" target="_blank">cuica</a>".  The next thing I knew, Neil figured out what it really was and started making some cool sounds with it.  Next time someone asks me about drum lessons, I'm sending them to Neil</p>  <p>To play it, you just hold the drum (which could also just be called a <em>tube</em>) so that the spring hangs down, and quickly shake the drum.  It sounds like friggin thunder, or a gong roll, or something.  You can also move your hand over the top to vary the sound.</p>  <p>Very cool stuff.  The spring drum is <em>exactly</em> the bizarre type of thing I was looking for.  Thanks for driving, Neil!</p>  <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="120" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Cuica_ArM.jpg" /><br /><em>A "cuica".  Not to be confused with a "spring drum".</em></p>  <p class="tags"> tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/music" target="_blank" rel="tag">music</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/drum" target="_blank" rel="tag">drum</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/weird" target="_blank" rel="tag">weird</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/spring" target="_blank" rel="tag">spring</a>  </p>
