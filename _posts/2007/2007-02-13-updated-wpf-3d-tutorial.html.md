title: "Updated WPF 3D Tutorial"
---

<p>I've updated the <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/technical/WPF3DTutorial.htm">WPF 3D Tutorial</a> to work with the latest <a title="WPF" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/" target="_blank">WPF</a> code in .Net 3.0.  The update is long overdue, as the .Net 3.0 bits have been out for some time now.  Both the tutorial text and source code are now up to date.</p>
  
<p>This was partially motivated by the fact that I'll be <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Spring2007/Sessions.aspx" target="_blank">giving a talk on 3D construction in WPF</a> in a few months.  My old WPF code needs to be dusted off a bit.  </p>
