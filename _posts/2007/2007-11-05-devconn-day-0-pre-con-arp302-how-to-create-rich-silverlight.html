title: "DevConn Day 0 [pre-con] ARP302 - How to create rich Silverlight applications"
---

<p>I attended a pre-conference session on Silverlight almost immediately after getting off the plane.  Unfortunately it wasn't a very good session for me.  I'm finding that most Silverlight sessions are about XAML - not the fine details about Silverlight.  </p> <p>This session covered the basics of setting up a Silverlight project in Visual Studio from scratch, which was good.  So far I've only seen Silverlight projects created from project templates.  I like being able to see stuff get set up without any smoke and mirrors and to see the raw code.  But after about 10 minutes of that, it was nothing but creating shapes and animations with XAML after that.  </p> <p>I keep hearing that Silverlight is nothing more than a way to deliver XAML across multiple browsers and OS's, and I finally believe that that is <strong><em>all</em></strong> there is to Silverlight.  If you know WPF and a little bit of ASP .Net and Javascript, then I wouldn't recommend going to a Silverlight presentation.  </p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:510f2fff-f303-412a-8e7c-2eea15431ce1" contenteditable="false">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/silverlight%20devconn" target="_blank" rel="tag">silverlight devconn</a></div>
