Sorry folks, but the next time I open it, everything you've written in your blogs will be marked as "read" without actually being read.</p>
<p>The Medalist Band's holiday concert was last night. It's always been at Edinborough Park in Edina. I found out about an hour and a half before the show that it was in Rosemount. About a 45 minute difference in drive time. But even more significant was the fact that a whole bunch of my family (including in and out of towners) was attending. It was a last minute scramble to get a hold of everyone and give them new directions. </p>
<p>The 2nd-most ridiculous requirement on a software development project ever (summed up in my own words): "we want you to implement the system with all out-of-the-box features, but we need it to do all of this custom stuff you can't do out-of-the-box. And can we have it be configurable so that we never have to call you for an enhancement?" Sure. How much time and money do you have? It's not enough.</p>
<p>The 1.5th-most ridiculous requirement: "develop everything with SharePoint lists".</p>
<p>I'm "music-sick". I miss writing and recording music. Our basement still isn't done. It's sooooo close to being finished, but there's just never any time. If it were done, I could make music more easily. We could really use the extra storage space too. </p>
<p>I have four personal days left to take off from work this year. Sweet. Extra-long holiday break for me!</p>
<p>This last paragraph is dedicated to everyone who has an extreme fondness of carp.</p>
