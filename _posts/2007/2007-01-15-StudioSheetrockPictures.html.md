<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/359108253/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/130/359108253_3df60df6af_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Used Green Glue" align="right" border="0" style="margin: 5px;" /></a>I just uploaded a few pictures of the progress made thus far on the studio sheetrock.  You can view them all at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/tags/sheetrock/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/tags/sheetrock/</a>.  Not a whole lot to see but you can get a feel for the progress, the room size, and how things might turn out.  </p>
  
<p>Heh, I also walked down there just now to make sure it's all holding up.  I'm crossing my fingers hoping that 1.25" of sheetrock doesn't come crashing down onto the floor :)</p>
