The basement is now completely covered with drywall. A single guy showed up today and did the remainder of the basement in about 6.5 hrs. It would have taken me about a month with the help of three other people! Pictures are available <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/tags/drywall/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Tomorrow the tapers and mudders are coming, and they'll be working all through next week. It's hard to believe that this project is now on its tail end. It's really easy to see the light at the end of the tunnel now that we can see the walls and get a feel for the real space now. It looks so weird! We're pretty excited about it.</p>
