<p>The snow blower is back in operation:</p> <p><a title="Snow blower is back by kindohm, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/2087391899/" target="_blank"><img height="400" alt="Snowblower is back" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2282/2087391899_675455cc32.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></a></p> <p>For the past two winters, the snow blower has been in an idle state, sitting with one axle on a wood block because of a flat and damaged tire. Until this year I've been too lazy to get the thing fixed. It arrived back from the shop today, just in time for our 2nd snowfall. </p> <p>And yes, I really did take a picture of my own snow blower. </p> <p>After clearing off the driveway tonight, I have no idea why I waited so long. What an easy-as-cake job that was.</p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:f2bc3913-dae3-4396-bac6-6aa559e9b8f5">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/snowblower%20winter" target="_blank" rel="tag">snowblower winter</a></div>
