<p>Makes me want to go back...</p>
  
<p>On a related note, Nikki's dad and stepmom missed their flight out of Paris a few weeks ago and had to stay there for an extra three days to avoid paying some large prices for new plane tickets.  If you're going to get stranded, I guess Paris would be a good place to be :)  Nikki and I were only able to spend a few hours in Paris a few years back, and I'd definitely choose to go back there so that we could see more.</p>
