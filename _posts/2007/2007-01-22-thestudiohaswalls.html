title: "The Studio Has Walls"
---

<p>This is what we did on Sunday:</p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/365459035/" target="_blank"><img height="333" alt="IMG_2979" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/138/365459035_f71846944f.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></a></p> <p>We're about 99% done with the studio sheetrock. I can count on one hand how many small pieces I have left to put up. I wanted my helpers to focus on the big pieces that I could get done on my own. All I have left are a few things around the electrical panel, one piece above the window, and one over the doorway. I should be able to get those done in an hour - maybe two if I'm slow :)</p> <p>I'm so glad that we made great progress yesterday, and it was outstanding to have four other people helping with the work. </p> <p>Looking back, I think it's really funny that I thought I could get that room done in a day. Instead it took two days of more than eight hours each. </p> <p>And of course, it's fun to imagine what it'll be like to make music in the room now that the walls have given it some shape. </p> <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/drywall" target="_blank" rel="tag">drywall</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/basement" target="_blank" rel="tag">basement</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/work" target="_blank" rel="tag">work</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/homeimprovement" target="_blank" rel="tag">homeimprovement</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/house" target="_blank" rel="tag">house</a>  </p>
