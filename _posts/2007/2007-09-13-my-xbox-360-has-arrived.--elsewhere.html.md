title: "My XBox 360 Has Arrived.  Elsewhere."
---

<p>My 360 finally arrived at the repair center:</p>
<pre><code>Device: Xbox360 Hardware
Serial Number: 209540163106 
Repair Status: Device Received at Service Center 
Carrier Name: UPS
Carrier Tracking Number: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx </code></pre>
<p>It took a little over three business days to get there.  "There" being "<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=MCALLEN,+TX,+US&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=26.207199,-98.22876&amp;spn=2.156092,4.312134&amp;z=9&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" target="_blank">here</a>".  A nice, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;saddr=2396+Molnau+Ct,+Chaska,+MN+55318+(home)&amp;daddr=McAllen,+TX&amp;sll=44.78725,-93.60184&amp;sspn=0.106604,0.269508&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=5&amp;om=1" target="_blank">long distance away from Chaska</a>.</p>
  
<p>If it takes 3 days to ship back, that means it'll need to ship by about Sept. 21st in order to get it back in time for <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> 3.  That means they've got about 10 days to get the damn thing repaired.  </p>
  
<p>Who knows what their backlog is.</p>
  
<p>I'm pessimistic about this.</p>
