title: "A step back to PS2"
---

<p>Since my XBox 360 is <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/archive/2007/09/01/xbox-and-halo-3-woes.aspx">hosed</a>, I dusted off my PS2 and hooked it back up.  The game I've been playing is Gran Turismo 4, which is only a couple of years old, I think.  It's basically the PS2 equivalent of Forza.  </p> <p>It's amazing to see where game user interface design has gone in a few years.  I found myself a little frustrated at navigating between the many different screens in GT4.  Between menu changes and loading, should it really take about 30 seconds for me to get back to my home garage?  I take for granted how much better UI's are now these days.  </p> <p>It's also kind of a letdown to <strong><em>not</em></strong> get any publicly recognizable reward for achieving something on the PS2.  I guess I've gotten really used to the Achievement features of the 360.  "Congratulations, you just spent 45 minutes on a series of championship races and won the entire series.  Here's some cash".  Screw that.  Give me my gamer points!</p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:0a290e86-b419-4905-aa15-08790fb9f0b9" contenteditable="false">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/forza" target="_blank" rel="tag">forza</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/gran%20turismo" target="_blank" rel="tag">gran turismo</a></div>
