title: "Dug-up demo - No One Knows"
---

<p>I recently discovered a CD in a desk drawer that has a demo of an old tune of mine. Go <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/MusicLibrary/Pages/SongDetail.aspx?SongID=616ac887-3862-4f8e-a0e4-214260b17fd2">have a listen</a>. </p> <p>The CD had a few other goodies on it too, but I'm not willing to share them yet as I'll probably use them for future material. I'm secretive like that.</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/music" target="_blank" rel="tag">music</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/demo" target="_blank" rel="tag">demo</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/song" target="_blank" rel="tag">song</a>  </p>
