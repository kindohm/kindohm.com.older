title: "Dad teaches keyboard shortcuts"
---

<p>Nikki took this picture while I was trying to teach eva Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V on the keyboard.  Unfortunately she can't do it with one hand.  It also didn't really seem to hold her attention :) I <em>have</em> to at least try to prevent her from developing a habit of using the mouse!</p>
