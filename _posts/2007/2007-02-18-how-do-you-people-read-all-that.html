title: "How do you people read all that?"

<p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" align="right" width="100" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gustavus.edu/xml/rssicon.png" />I'm a bit RSS impaired. I subscribe to about 35 feeds through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and it's more than I can keep up with. Almost daily I see about 30-60 new items, and my reaction is to mark all as "read" and close my browser. It's barely even worth my time to skim through them and find the articles I'd be interested in. </p> <p>How do people with 200+ feed subscriptions keep up? Do I just not value taking the time to sit and read? I just can't consume information that way these days. I'd rather spend time writing posts wondering how other people consume large amounts of information.</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/blog" target="_blank" rel="tag">blog</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/read" target="_blank" rel="tag">read</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/web" target="_blank" rel="tag">web</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/reader" target="_blank" rel="tag">reader</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rss" target="_blank" rel="tag">rss</a>  </p>
