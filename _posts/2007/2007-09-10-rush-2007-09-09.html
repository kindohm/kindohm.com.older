I hadn't seen them since the last time.  I also can't remember the last arena concert I went to.  I think it may have been Sara McLachlan in 2004... but I digress...  </p> <p>The last time I saw Rush it was in 1994 and I was a little disappointed.  This time around it was pretty good.  That show in 1994 was my first concert ever and I think my expectations were just too high for an arena.  This time we had good seats and a good ear-line to the sound system.  It was almost a relief to hear the opening notes of their first tune sound good.  </p> <p>The best part of the entire show was just being able to see three of the most influential musicians in the history of modern rock on stage.  These days, I usually end up shying away from mainstream music, but it felt great to witness a performance by a great band who has had a significant impact on my musical tastes (and drumming).  I mean, had I never listened to <em>Permanent Waves</em>, I may have quit playing the drums altogether and ended up getting a job wiping puke off the floor of some arena somewhere!</p> <p>It was really fun seeing them play.  Hopefully they'll crank out another album someday.</p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:55a78c47-522d-4711-a3ef-ed8c8137478e" contenteditable="false">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/rush" target="_blank" rel="tag">rush</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/concert" target="_blank" rel="tag">concert</a></div>
