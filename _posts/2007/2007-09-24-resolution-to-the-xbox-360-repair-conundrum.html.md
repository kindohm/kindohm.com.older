title: "Resolution to the XBox 360 Repair Conundrum?"
---


<p>Go figure - as soon as I <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2007/09/24/xbox-repair-customer-service-lousy.aspx" target="_blank">write up a rant</a> on my XBox 360 repair experience, I check my repair status online and find this new information:</p>
<pre><code>Device: Xbox360 Hardware
Serial Number: XXXXXXXXXXXX
Warranty Status: In Warranty
Repair Status: Device Shipped to Customer</code></pre>
<p>The new <em>"Device Shipped to Customer"</em> text is encouraging.  How could this be encouraging after all the lies, deceit, struggle, agony, and pain?  Well, I'm not sure, except I was able to find a new tracking number on a linked page from where the above information was located on their service site.  It's probably accurate information.  Probably.  </p>
