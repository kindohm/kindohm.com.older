<p><img style="margin: 5px" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51b75jKobRL._AA240_.jpg" width="150" align="right" />Static X has hit their stride with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cannibal-Static-X/dp/B000NJLLWY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6239190-0738350?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1183387373&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Cannibal</a>. They've cornered the market with their Evil Disco/Undead Metal sound. But then, who else has an Evil Disco/Undead Metal sound?  </p> <p>Their debut was great, but their 2nd two albums were downright boring.  Their last two have now been pretty good.  What I like best about them is that I don't think they take themselves very seriously.  I think they've started to hone in on that fact and as a result have created something very heavy and pleasantly disturbing.  </p> <p>My favorite Static X moment: Wayne Static asks the crowd, "Do you guys like poop?".  The crowd screams "YEEAAHHH!!".  Wayne Static says "you guys are weird".  </p> <p>Perhaps the best part of all about Cannibal is the inside cover album art:</p> <p><a href="http://static-x.com/sites/static-x.com/files/images/newstaticphoto2.preview.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://static-x.com/sites/static-x.com/files/images/newstaticphoto2.preview.jpg" width="450" border="0" /></a></p> <p class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:35819c57-00eb-4e13-96cd-b85a8201d7d9" contenteditable="false">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/static-x" target="_blank" rel="tag">static-x</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/static%20x" target="_blank" rel="tag">static x</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/rock" target="_blank" rel="tag">rock</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/cannibal" target="_blank" rel="tag">cannibal</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/album" target="_blank" rel="tag">album</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/wayne%20static" target="_blank" rel="tag">wayne static</a></p>
