title: "Sheetrock - Day 1"
---

<p>This past Sunday I completed the first round of hanging sheetrock in the studio.  I made about 1/2 the amount of progress that I expected and only finished the ceiling and one wall.  The work went very well though - it was just slow.</p>
  
<p>First, we re-hung the resilient channel on the ceiling.  We added a few strips to decrease the spacing from 24" to 16" apart.  We also re-oriented the channel so that it was easier to hang sheetrock by its 4' or 8' lengths.  We also needed tp spend some extra time planning out the ceiling panel layout - as I wanted to make sure that the seams in the first and second layers of sheetrock didn't match up.</p>
  
<p>The next thing that made it take long was caulking.  Caulking every seam between the sheetrock panels in the first layer is an important "soundproofing" step.  It's just another thing that took time.</p>
  
<p>Then there was the <a href="http://www.greengluecompany.com" target="_blank">Green Glue</a>.  Again, it was easy to do, but it was just another step.  The coolest part about it is that you can hear the Green Glue ooze and crackle as it spreads out inside the to layers of drywall when you start putting screws in.</p>
  
<p>Applying two layers of sheetrock also took a lot of time.  Arguably we put up enough sheetrock to cover the entire room - but it was just on two surfaces.  </p>
  
<p>I was really happy with how easy the resilient channel was to work with.  I was anticipating that it'd be difficult, but it wasn't at all.  I thought it'd be tough to screw in to, but the day before we started I learned that using fine-threaded drywall screws makes it pretty easy - and it was.</p>
  
<p>We'll probably finish up the room on the 21st or 28th.  I'm pretty confident we can finish in another day.  </p>
