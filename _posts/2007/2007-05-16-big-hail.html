title: "Big Hail"

<p>Yikes, now this is some big hail:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/501542118/" title="Photo Sharing" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/228/501542118_b78a786e4e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Hail #2" /></a></p>  <p>My dad took this picture (in Duluth) after storms rolled through a few days ago.  Luckily he (or the cars) weren't home when this stuff fell.  His neighbors said that the hail started out around the size of baseballs.  This picture was taken after it had already melted a bit.  Note the plastic, practice golf ball in the picture for scale.</p>  <p class="tags">   tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hail" rel="tag" target="_blank">hail</a> </p>
