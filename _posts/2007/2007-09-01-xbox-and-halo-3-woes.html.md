title: "XBox and Halo 3 Woes"

<p><img width="150" src="http://www.smashmyxbox.com/images/smx1.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 5px;" />I have fallen victim to the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/05/xbox-360-warranty-extended-to-three-years/" target="_blank">33% failure rate</a> of the XBox 360.  Last night my games kept freezing, and I saw the red ring of death once.  This morning I was on the phone with XBox 360 support, and the red ring re-appeared and the games kept freezing while we were troubleshooting.</p>
  
<p>Most importantly, through troubleshooting, we ruled out the game(s) and hard drive as the problem.  The console by itself is busted.  Now I can't even get the "boot up" screen to show up (although the audio works).  </p>
  
<p>The good news: I'm covered under the warranty and Microsoft will pay the bill for everything, including shipping to a repair center.</p>
  
<p>The bad news: it takes 3-4 weeks to get your console back.  Not good timing for the September 25th <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> 3 release date.  It's too close to call.  I may very well be without a console when the game releases.  </p>
