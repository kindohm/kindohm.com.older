title: "Forget Halo 3 in 1080p...  what about Halo 4?!"
---

<p><a href="http://www.jasonbock.net" target="_blank">Jason</a> sent me this link this morning: <a href="http://www.playthree.net/2007/04/halo-3-to-support-true-not-upscaled.html" target="_blank">Halo 3 to support True (not upscaled) 1080p at 60fps</a>.  Ok cool, but at the bottom of the article there are these tidbits:</p>  <div style="padding-left: 15px;"> <p><em>Two other major tidbits.</em></p> <ul> <li><em>The next true <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> sequel (Halo 4?) will use a new game engine and depending on everything, could be a launch title for the new Xbox in 'Fall' 2010/11.</em></li>  <li><em>A semi-sequel to Halo 3 is a possibility, it would use the Halo 3 engine. But this is most likely going to be new weapons/levels/vehicles.</em></li>  </ul> </div>  <p>Halo 4?  Or Halo 3.5?  I honestly didn't see that coming.  I'll save judgement until after I play Halo 3 though.  Maybe there'll be a good reason for a sequel.  If Bungie can keep pushing the envelope with game tech then maybe it'd be a good thing anyway.  But the other side of me says who the hell really wants to see yet another game with Red vs. Blue machinima and multiplayer first-person-shooter gameplay on xbox live?  </p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/halo" target="_blank" rel="tag">halo</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/xbox" target="_blank" rel="tag">xbox</a> </p>
