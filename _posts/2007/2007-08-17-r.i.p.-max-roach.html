He was the first drummer I ever truly <em>studied</em>, and I transcribed a few of his solos back when I took drum set lessons.  I also played his <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=%22blues+for+big+sid%22" target="_blank">Blues for Big Sid</a> drum solo.  I can't say I kept up with anything he had done recently, but to this day I listen to his old stuff.</p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:65d8b118-3ac2-4a1e-be02-4fe766902c2f" contenteditable="false">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/max%20roach" target="_blank" rel="tag">max roach</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/drums" target="_blank" rel="tag">drums</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/jazz" target="_blank" rel="tag">jazz</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/musician" target="_blank" rel="tag">musician</a></div>
