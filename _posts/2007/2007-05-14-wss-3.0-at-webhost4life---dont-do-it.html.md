title: "WSS 3.0 at WebHost4Life - don&#39;t do it"
---

<p>I just wasted $20.  I subscribed to my web host's (<a href="http://www.webhost4life.com" target="_blank">webhost4life.com</a>) Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 offering, only to find that site owners do not have access to their own WSS virtual root.  That means no bin folder, no wpcatalog folder, and no web.config file.  All you get is out-of-the-box stuff.  </p>
  
<p>Webhost4life.com does not say much about their WSS 3.0 offering on their site.  Arguably I was a bad consumer and didn't look in to it deeply enough before making my payment.  I will say though that their WSS 2.0 offering <em><strong>does</strong></em> allow customizations, and I thought it was safe enough to assume they'd offer the same thing in WSS 3.0.  </p>
  
<p>If you're a business and need basic WSS 3.0 functionality, go for it.  If you're a WSS developer, don't even bother with webhost4life.com.</p>
