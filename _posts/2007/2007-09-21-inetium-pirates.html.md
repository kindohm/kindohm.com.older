title: "Inetium Pirates"
---

<p>Each year, <a href="http://www.inetium.com" target="_blank">Inetium</a> does an outdoor outing for its employees.  It's a team competition where you do races and other contests, followed by food and shenanigans.  </p>
<p>This year, my team dressed up as pirates for the occasion:</p>

<p>From the left, it's Dan, me, Dana, Tara, Ted, Justin, and Bela. I don't even look like a pirate. I'm some sort of psychotic pigmy wearing swim trunks:</p>

<p>Our team ended up coming in dead last - a victory! We tried hard to lose every event and we succeeded. It just goes to show that you can never stop employees who dress like pirates. Or psychotic pigmies. </p>
