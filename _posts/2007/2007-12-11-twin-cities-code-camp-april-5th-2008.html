<p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="184" alt="Picture 44" src="http://kindohm.com/localimages/posts/TwinCitiesCodeCampApril5th2008_6E32/Picture44.jpg" width="244" align="right" border="0" />The next <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com" target="_blank">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> is on April 5th, 2008.  I'm tentatively presenting on a SharePoint topic.  I'm busting out of the WPF 3D mode and changing it up a bit.  I'm curious to see who will attend a SharePoint topic.   If I'm ambitious enough I might even give a couple of presentations, but I don't have a 2nd one in mind.  </p> <p>If you're interested in attending, it's too early to sign up, so keep your eyes peeled (via the <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/rss.aspx" target="_blank">TCCC RSS feed</a>).  If you're interested in presenting, they are still looking for presenters, as far as I know.  There is information on the site if you want to present.  </p> <p>The event will probably be held at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=new+horizons&amp;near=Edina,+MN&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=0,0,1550009581448735178&amp;ll=44.863656,-93.313751&amp;spn=0.025551,0.067463&amp;t=p&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;om=1" target="_blank">New Horizons in Edina</a>.  Please check back at <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com">www.twincitiescodecamp.com</a> though for the actual details on the location.  Assume I'm wrong.  For all I know it'll actually be held at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=metrodome&amp;near=minneapolis&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.973178,-93.259592&amp;spn=0.012751,0.033731&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Metrodome</a>.</p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:39a19286-c353-428a-a70a-472a53649490">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/twin%20cities%20code%20camp" rel="tag" target="_blank">twin cities code camp</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/sharepoint" rel="tag" target="_blank">sharepoint</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/code" rel="tag" target="_blank">code</a></div>
