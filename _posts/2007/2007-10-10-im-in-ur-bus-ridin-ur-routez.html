title: "im in ur bus ridin ur routez"

<p>Today I rode the bus to work for the first time.  I've been working in downtown Minneapolis for about 1.5 months so far, and will be here for about another month.  I get reimbursed for parking and the extra mileage, but $7 per day for parking is a pretty annoying dent in the wallet between reimbursement checks.  When I started this current gig downtown, I figured I'd try the bus at least once, but now the driving and parking is actually starting to wear on me and my wallet (even though he wallet pain is temporary week to week).  So, I decided to get a bus pass and do the mass transit thing from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=Chaska,+MN+55318&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Chaska</a>.  </p> <p>It was nice to not have to drive or think during the commute and time went by quickly.  The mp3 player came in handy :)  </p> <div class="tags" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:e14c8207-75ca-46a2-aa22-a566590a6963" contenteditable="false">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bus" target="_blank" rel="tag">bus</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/downtown" target="_blank" rel="tag">downtown</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="tag">minneapolis</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/chaska" target="_blank" rel="tag">chaska</a></div>
