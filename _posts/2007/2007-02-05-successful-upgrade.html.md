title: "Successful Upgrade"
---


<p>The <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> upgrade to v1.9.2 pretty much went without a hitch.  And as for the new skin - now that I've had some time to live with it I'm not sure how happy I am with it.  Nikki mentioned that "kindohm.com" isn't very noticeable right away on the home page, and now that's bugging me.  I may make a few small changes to account for that.</p>
