title: "Halo 3 Custom Armor"
---

<p>I had read somewhere a while back that Bungie was going to introduce the ability to mix and match different armor parts for when you customize the appearance of your multiplayer character.  I just came across <a href="http://www.bungie.net/images/News/InlineImages2007/BetaBeyond/Halo3_Snowbound_3rd-person-06.jpg" target="_blank">this screen shot</a> where the nearest Spartan in the foreground has a unique helmet.  The red Spartan that is jumping and firing in the upper left (with the Brute Shot) also seems to have a weird looking helmet.  A preview of things to come?</p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">UPDATE</font></strong>: There are actually quite a few screen shots of the new armor.  You can browse through all of them in Bungie's Halo 3 screen shot slide viewer: <a href="http://www.bungie.net/projects/halo3/asset_popup_viewer.aspx?at=59&amp;cc=21&amp;item=13" target="_blank">link</a>.  </p>
