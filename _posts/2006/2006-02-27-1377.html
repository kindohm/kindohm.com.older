title: "Movie - Heat"
---

<p>Nikki and I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/" target="_blank">Heat</a> (Pacino, Di Nero) this weekend.  I thought it was pretty good, but what I really liked about it was the shootout scene in downtown L.A.  I liked it because it wasn't fluffed and overdone like a typical Hollywood action movie, but severely loud and violent.  No music, no big explosions.  Just automatic rifles and it was f*cking loud and scary.  I'd recommend the movie just for that scene.  </p>  <p>Update: found it on youtube.com.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=a1DUxCI7gKk" target="_blank">Link</a>.</p>  <p> <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/a1DUxCI7gKk"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/a1DUxCI7gKk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object> </p>
