title: "The Heretic Anthem on Conan"

<p>I've been looking for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=eZ__wClUxXY">this video</a> for about three years.  Believe it or not, I saw this on my wedding night.  I'd never seen a band this heavy play on national network television.  I think it's somewhat impressive that Corey (vocalist) left out all of the f-bombs in the lyrics without accidentally slipping one in.  Anyway, this is an excellent modern metal performance.  Even if you don't like Slipknot or heavy music you should watch this.  </p>
