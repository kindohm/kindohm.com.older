Our Cingular plan is <em>finally</em> over. I have no idea what Cingular is talking about on their commercials where they claim to have the fewest dropped calls. Nikki and I experience dropped calls on our cell phones about 50% of the time [1]. It hasn't been in just one area either. It just always seems to happen.</p>
<p>So now we're with Verizon. Our friends and relatives have been pretty happy with them, and that's why we chose them. Any other carrier (besides Cingular) probably would have been fine too. </p>
<p>I wanted to get a RAZR because it's super flat. It's front is actually a little bigger than most flip phones, but for sticking in your pocket it's excellent because it's so flat. I don't have a big bulge sticking out of my pants any more. Did I just say that?</p>
<p>It also sports a camera phone which I've never had. I cannot wait to over-use it :) Other than that, it's a phone. It has a few other nice features like speakerphone and voice recog., but I don't expect to really use those that much. For the amount of calling I actually do, a flat phone and a reliable carrier are all I really need.</p>
