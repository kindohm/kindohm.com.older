title: "A mid-December update"
---

<p>Life and work have been insanely busy lately and I thought I'd make sure things don't get too stale around here an post a quick update...</p> <p>On the basement front, I now have 41 panels of sheetrock in my basement, ready to be hung. Nikki's stepdad and I carried them down the basement 1 at a time last week, and I don't care to ever do that again. Now it's a matter of finding a weekend to wall-up the studio room. </p> <p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" src="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/0765315688.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_OU01_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_V36729316_.jpg" align="right" />I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghosts-Onyx-Halo-Eric-Nylund/dp/0765315688/sr=8-1/qid=1166543447/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7384975-2007826?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</a>. It's the fourth book in the <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> series and chronologically it takes place at multiple times in the Halo story - although it seems to center around the same period as the Halo: CE and Halo 2 game plots (rather than pre-Halo: CE like <em>Fall of Reach</em>). I'm really enjoying it... if you're into the Halo story then you'll like that this book seems to tie up a LOT of loose ends in the game and book plotlines. However, it opens up even more questions. I'm about 3/4 done with the book.</p> <p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" src="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000F0UT38.01._AA280_SCLZZZZZZZ_V64255673_.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I got an XBox 360! It picked it up this past weekend at <a href="http://www.microcenter.com" target="_blank">Microcenter</a>, which had a $100 rebate on a Premium system. Nice! The only game I picked up was Table Tennis and I've also downloaded Geometry Wars, which are both pretty fun. I also signed up for the <a href="http://www.halo3.com" target="_blank">Halo 3 Beta</a>, which is only available to XBox 360 systems. Not sure when the Beta is going to be available to play... and based on the sign-up site I'm not sure if it'll be well-organized, but I'm eager to play it.</p> <p>That's about it. Hopefully we'll get some snow in a few days! </p>
