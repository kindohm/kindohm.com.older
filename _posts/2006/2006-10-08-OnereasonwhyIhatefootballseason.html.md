title: "One reason why I hate football season"

<p>The pace of NFL games is ridiculously slow.  Every Sunday I look forward to watching the Vikings, and before the first quarter is over I'm bored to death.  The effect is even worse after watching an NHL game the night before.  </p>
  
<p>Another thing are the commercial breaks.  Some days the networks just have the commercial programming all screwed up.  For three commercial breaks in a row (and more than five times during just the first quarter), I saw this Volkswagen commercial during the Vikings/Lions game:</p>

<p>I like the commercial, but seeing it that many times makes me want to ensure I never buy a Volkswagen.  It actually caused us to change the channel and stop watching the game a few times.  Whatever marketing strategy FOX and Volkswagen had for during the game backfired.  </p>
  
<p>Is it really that big of a deal?  No.  But it was either this or post about what I ate for breakfast today.  Or something.</p>
