title: "Resilient Channel - NOT Done!"
---

<p>Dammit!</p> <p>If you know me, then you know that I rarely get angry, upset, or down about almost anything. This afternoon I found some information on an excellent recording studio construction site that made my heart sink. I was visibly upset and my coworkers noticed and they asked what was wrong. I had learned that I installed all of the resilient channel in my studio upside down.</p> <p>Seven hours later, the shock of this knowledge has disappeared and I can think reasonably about it. In fact, I've learned a <em><strong>lot</strong></em> about studio construction as a result of it because I've researched my ass off in the process. I picked up a copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Home-Recording-Studio-Build-Pros/dp/1598630342/ref=sr_11_1/104-8085951-4867943?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Home Recording Studio: Build it like the pros</a></em>, which has some of the best construction information I've ever read.</p> <p>The good news is that since I've learned that I installed the RC incorrectly, I've learned about two or three other things that I'll be able to do while hanging drywall that will significantly help reduce sound transmission to the rest of the house from the studio. So even though I'll need to do a lot of rework, some good has come out of this. See, that's my optimistic, happy side that you're used to seeing coming out! </p> <p>So - back to work. Someday.</p>
