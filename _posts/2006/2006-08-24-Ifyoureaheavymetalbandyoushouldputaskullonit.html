<p>A little YouTube artifact... the Melvins on some German show (circa early 90's?) talking about album covers. Take a look:</p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K56dW1jp0Ik" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K56dW1jp0Ik</a></p> <object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/K56dW1jp0Ik" /> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/K56dW1jp0Ik" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object> <p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" alt="Melvins" src="http://www.kaztsurudome.com/melvins/images/03.jpg" width="200" align="left" /> Also, the Melvins are out of the studio and will be releasing another CD on October 10th (supposedly). They'll also be playing at the Fine Line in Minneapolis on September 25th, but I'm not sure I can make it. We shall see. </p><br /><br /><br /><br />
