title: "Halo 3 Multiplayer Screenshots, public beta, and more"
---

<p>I stumbled across a lot of <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> 3 tidbits while eating lunch today. First off, there are 33 Halo 3 screenshots and images available to view over at 1up.com. <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/media?cId=3144308&amp;mt=0" target="_blank">View them all here</a>. Lots of juicy visuals to browse through. From what I can tell there are three multiplayer maps in the screenshots. One of them looks like it'll be a Zanzibar-esque map with a base and some interactive features of the map environment (e.g. doors to open, etc):</p>

<p>I can't be sure, but there is a diagram of a map that looks like the one above. The diagram illustrates the use of a "big ass" mortar gun. Very cool:</p>

<p>There's also an image of a Spartan wielding what looks like a new weapon:</p>

<p>Perhaps a weapon good for melee attacks because of its blades?</p>
<p>Bungie also announced that Halo 3 multiplayer will be available in beta form to XBox 360/XBox Live subscribers next year. You play, you provide data to Bungie, you help make a better game. </p>
<p>Finally, there are also new Halo 2 maps coming out that will be only available on XBox 360. Bummer for me. Another reason to keep saving my pennies for a 360.</p>
