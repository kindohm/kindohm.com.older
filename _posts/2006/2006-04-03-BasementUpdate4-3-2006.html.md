<p>This weekend I made substantial progress on our basement, and now all I want to do is to keep working on it.  I finished all of the small, annoying framing work that was left.  There were spots left around the window and a lot of misc. nailers to put up in corners.  </p>
  
<p>Nikki's stepdad and I took a trip to Home Depot and we picked up asbout $150 worth of insulation.  I got one big package of R-19 for the ceiling/soffit areas in the music room, and three packs of Kraft-faced R-13 for the walls in that room.  The music room has a soffit that hangs down below the celing along the room's length, and I stuffed it completely full with two layers of R-19.  With what was left I put a few more R-19 bats in between some of the joists.  Then I put up about three bats of the R-13 on one wall, but I had to stop because I ran out of staples.  </p>
  
<p>I'm eager to get more insulating done because it's a quiet activity, and I can do it at night after Eva goes to bed.  The only thing bad about it is protecting yourself from the fiberglass.  Working with a long-sleeve shirt, respirator, bulky safety glasses and a hat gets a bit hot and suffocating.  But it's pretty simple work, which is really nice...  framing takes a bit more muscle, and I think that might be why I procrastinate at times :)</p>
