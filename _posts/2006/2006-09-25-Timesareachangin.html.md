<p>Goodbye <a href="http://www.thoughtstoblog.com" target="_blank">Jake</a>. <a title="Jake" href="http://www.thoughtstoblog.com" target="_blank">Jake</a>'s last day at <a href="http://www.inetium.com" target="_blank">Inetium</a> was last Friday. Jake always kept the office energized and exciting, and we'll miss his presence along with his developer skills. I'll still get to see him around though... there's a LAN party coming up on the 13th!</p>
<p>Also at that LAN party will be John Downing, who is starting at Inetium next Monday! I used to work with John on my team at <a href="http://www.nextelpartners.com" target="_blank">Nextel Partners</a>. John will be joining our IW group. Welcome John!</p>
