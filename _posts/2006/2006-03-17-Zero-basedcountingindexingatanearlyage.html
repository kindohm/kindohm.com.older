title: "Zero-based indexing at an early age"

<p>Nikki sometimes makes toys for Eva out of inexpensive everyday household things. Example: the metal tops from frozen juice canisters. Eva absolutely loves playing with them because they're easy to pick up, kinda shiny, and make noise when she hits them together.</p> <p>So Nikki decided to "make" some more of the juice tops for Eva to play with and put numbers on them so that she can start to work with numbers. Nikki called and asked "should I use either a number 'ten' or a number 'zero'? Without hesitation, I said "zero". </p> <p>We're going to start her off right with zero-based counting. We'll have her writing code in no time. Eva will be seven months old tomorrow - you can't start too early, can you? :)</p> <p><font color="#ffa500"><strong>Update:</strong> </font>Just to clarify - I'm serious about the metal tops. They are <strong><em>not</em></strong> sharp ones that you have to cut off with a can opener or anything. I'm talking about the frozen Dole juice cans where you pull a zip-line thing to rip off the seal, and then there's a metal cap with round edges. Nothing sharp. C'mon - just because my household is crazy doesn't mean we're stupid ;) </p>
