I think back in v1.5 they introduced the <a href="http://www.angrypets.com/tools/rdos/" target="_blank">ReverseDOS</a> spam blocker in <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a>.  That is reason enough for me to want to upgrade, as optimistically (if it works) I won't have to use a CAPTHCA image control for folks who want to post comments.  Since 1.5 they've also supported a few different text box providers for writing posts, including a plain text provider, which I would love.</p>
  
<p>v2.0 sounds like it'll be cool as they're developing a plugin framework.  I could see myself stepping up development on my personal site a bit once they get that done.  One reason I don't do a lot of custom stuff integrated with my blog is that it's just too hairy with Subtext.  They also upgraded to ASP .Net 2.0 in v1.9, which is another incentive to write some code.  </p>
