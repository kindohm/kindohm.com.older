title: "Inspector Hours"

<p>I want to be a state electrical inspector.  I called him this morning to schedule the 2nd rough-in inspection for this afternoon, but he said they only do inspections from 9:00 to 11:00 AM.  I couldn't do that today because of meetings.  Damn, those are some nice hours :)  Guess I'll wait until Monday.</p>
