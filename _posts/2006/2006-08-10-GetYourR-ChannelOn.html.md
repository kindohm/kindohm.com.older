title: "Get Your R-Channel On"
---

<p>On Tuesday after work I picked up about $200 worth of resilient channel (a.k.a. RC) to begin one of the final stages of soundproofing in the basement. Damn, I should have taken a picture to make this post more interesting... but anyway, it was a lot of metal to haul in the little Honda Civic [1]. </p>
<p>I also picked up a metal cut-off saw blade for cutting the RC with my miter saw.  I have a hacksaw, but I figured I'd need to make somewhere between 30 and 50 cuts, and I'd rather not use a hacksaw for that much sawing.  The cut-off blade looks like a vinyl record or a thin grinding wheel.  Kinda weird... it's just a lightweight, abrasive material.  Makes sense though when you see it and think about it.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to put up all the RC in August. What does that mean? It means that we'll probably have drywall up in September! That is such a huge milestone because this project has dragged on for about two years now. After drywall, I'll complete the final stage of soundproofing too, which includes filling in drywall gaps with expanding foam and caulk. </p>
<p>Also on the soundproofing front, I have a Soundproofing Tutorial in the works. There is very little <em><strong>good</strong></em> information out on the internet about soundproofing, so I thought I'd attempt to fill that gap with some writing and illustrations that are actually coherent and based on real-world experience. Not that I'm a great writer or anything, but most stuff out there is crap and it drives me crazy when people make a poor attempt at trying to explain a complex subject.</p>
<p>[1] Yet more support for not needing to buy a truck or SUV. I've worked on this entire project while owning an Accord and a Civic. There are very few loads I've hauled where a truck was needed, and on those rare occasions it's been easy to call up a relative who'll be more than glad to help. I wondered about 2-3 years ago if I'd need a truck for all the work on this project, and now I know that I didn't.</p>
