<p>Here's a nifty little video segment about over-the-top shots in ice hockey.  Even if you don't like hockey, it's still fun listening to those thick Canadian accents of the players being interviewed in the video :) </p> <p><a href="http://media.tsn.ca/nhl/hotdog_hi.wmv#">http://media.tsn.ca/nhl/hotdog_hi.wmv</a></p> <p>I think that Shremp's 2nd shot in the video is actually more impressive.  I think it's the same one that a Rangers defenseman pulled off in a shootout last season.</p>
