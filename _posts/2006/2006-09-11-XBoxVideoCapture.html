title: "XBox Video Capture"
---

<p>I'm playing around with the idea of capturing XBox gameplay footage for the <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2006/09/09/Halo2LANPartyOctober13th2006.aspx">LAN party</a> next month. I don't have any experience with video/audio capture and I'm not sure exactly what to buy or look at.</p> <p>My requirements aren't very extensive:</p> <ul> <li>USB interface (rather than a PCI card)  </li><li>Reasonable video/audio quality  </li><li>As inexpensive as possible  </li><li>Must work 100% of the time and not be a pain in the ass </li></ul> <p>As for video quality, I'm not exactly going to make redistributable DVD's with this thing. I just want to edit some videos to share online. I'm not very knowledgeable about screen resolutions.... something that can be watched without squinting on a computer is fine.</p> <p>So, I came across this on Amazon.com:</p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a href="" target="_blank"><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B0009UDABW.01-A9B09ZK9BZJQ6._AA280_SCLZZZZZZZ_V41362312_.jpg" width="200" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/B0009UDABW/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/104-5840764-7523121?ie=UTF8&amp;customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-SubmissionDate&amp;n=172282" target="_blank">ADS Tech Video Xpress USBAV-191-EF</a></em></p> <p>Anyone out there have experience with this stuff? Think that the ADS gadget would do the trick? The customer reviews seem decent enough. </p> <p>I also need to figure out what software I'll need to capture the code. I know Windows Movie Maker can capture video but I think it's might be more geared toward capturing off of a camcorder. Not sure. </p> <p>Any input would be great. Otherwise I'll be researching this a bit.</p>
