title: "Virtual Puck season winding down"
---

<p>The regular season at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virtualpuck.com">VirtualPuck.com</a> is starting to wind down.  January is the last full month of games, and a few games will be played in February.  Who will make the playoffs?  Will the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virtualpuck.com/TeamView.aspx?TeamID=36">Alpacas</a> pull off a string of wins and rise back into league dominance?  Will <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virtualpuck.com/PlayerView.aspx?PlayerID=206">Jake Good</a> continue his scoring run and be named league MVP?  Will <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virtualpuck.com/PlayerView.aspx?PlayerID=246">Sean Connery</a> continue his mindblowing goaltending performance?</p>
