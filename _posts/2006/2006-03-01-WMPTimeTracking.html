title: "Use WMP for Time Tracking"
---

<p>As a consultant, I'm accountable for every minute I spend working during the day.  Unfortunately I get pulled into impromptu discussions and meetings throughout the day.  For those interruptions, I rarely check what time it is when I leave or get back to my desk, so I have no idea how much time I just spent doing something else.  </p>  <p>But I discovered today that Windows Media Player can serve as a great backup measure to this problem.  For example, I was pulled into a conversation this morning while listening to an <a href="http://www.edgey.net" target="_blank">Edgey</a> playlist.  When I got back, I took note of what songs I had missed, and realized that I could do the math and estimate how much time I was away from my desk based on the length of the tracks.  </p>  <p>Moral of the story:  listen to music while you work, and don't pet the alpacas.</p>
