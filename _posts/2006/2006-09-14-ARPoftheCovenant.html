<p>Wow. Check these guys out: <a href="http://www.arpofthecovenant.com" target="_blank">www.ArpOfTheCovenant.com</a>.</p> <p>In my <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2006/09/14/OpenPercussionistSpot-needcandidates.aspx">hunt for a percussionist</a> I came across this band's site while Googling for an old friend, who happens to be their drummer. I had no idea he went so far musically. He's a talented drummer and plays with a talented group.</p> <p>The band plays electro-funk, avant-jazz kind of stuff. Odd time sigs. Ambient to groove to frantic drum-n-bass-inspired insanity. Lots of improv. The guys have an interesting live show too.</p> <p>For audio and hi-res video of a few live performances, check out their <a href="http://www.arpofthecovenant.com/press.html" target="_blank">press kit page</a>. The audio and video both have great production quality, which always yields great praise from me.  In other words, the videos aren't of amateur YouTube quality.  </p>
