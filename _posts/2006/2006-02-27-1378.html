<p>If you leave a comment on <a href="http://www.forgetfoo.com" target="_blank">Foo's blog</a> and you have your computer speakers turned on, make sure you turn them off before clicking the button to submit your comment if you're at work.  I know better....  I just forgot this morning.  Luckily my nearest co-worker wasn't around yet, but I'm sure a couple others heard it.  My apologies Jon and Vince :)  </p>
