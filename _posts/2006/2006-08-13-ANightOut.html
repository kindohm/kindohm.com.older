We parked over at the new Guthrie and then walked over to dinner at the <a href="http://www.osf.com/" target="_blank">Old Spaghetti Factory</a>. They have damn good lasagna. </p> <p>After dinner we walked back to the Guthrie, saw <a href="http://guthrietheater.org/PLAYSTICKETS/20062007Season/TheRealThing/tabid/56/Default.aspx" target="_blank">The Real Thing</a>, and checked out a bit of the new Guthrie site. The show was excellent and I'd recommend seeing it. We sat in the third row, and it wasn't too close... for drama I think it's always fun to be able to see the actors act up close.</p> <p>We were originally planning on seeing The Chris Olson Trio at <a href="http://www.dakotacooks.com/" target="_blank">The Dakota</a>, but the show didn't start until 11:30. The grandparents had Eva overnight, and we were picking her up in the morning. Some long, uninterrupted sleep was also a plan for our evening, so we decided to change plans and not go to such a late show. Man this paragraph has nothing but "I'm getting old" written all over it. If you've never been to the Dakota before, then I highly recommend it. It's one of the town's biggest (not in terms of size) jazz venues and it's a great setting.</p> <p>The area around the Guthrie that is being developed is really picking up steam... tis going to be a busy place in Minneapolis once everything gets built...</p>
