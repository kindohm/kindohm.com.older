title: "Flag Burning Vote"
---

<p>I had no idea that such an important [sarcasm] issue was being debated in our nation's capital right now:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/27/flag.burning/index.html" target="_blank">Flag Burning Amendment Fails by a Vote</a></p>
  
<p>It'll be a sad day when free speech rights like this are taken away.  I rarely talk about politics on my site, but I had to say something about this.</p>
  
<p><em>"From the Senate floor Monday, (Arlen) Specter compared flag desecration to libel and child pornography, forms of expression he said have no 'social value.'"</em></p>
  
<p>Someone please help me see the similarity.</p>
  
<p><em>"'The First Amendment never needs defending when it comes to popular speech,' (Patrick) Leahy said. 'It's when it comes to unpopular speech that it needs defending.'"</em></p>
  
<p>How true.  Contact your senators and representatives and tell them how you feel.</p>
