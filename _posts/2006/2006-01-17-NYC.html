<p>We're going to New York City!  Nikki and I booked the flights and hotel last night.  We're staying at <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=45+WEST+35+STREET,+new+york,+ny&btnG=Search&t=k&ll=40.751272,-73.989787&spn=0.012045,0.02871&t=k">The Hotel Metro</a>, which is extremely close to the Empire State Building, a few blocks from Madison Square Garden, and about 10 blocks from Times Square.  The trip isn't for a couple of months yet, but we're really looking forward to it.  We already bought tickets to a  New York Rangers game too.  Everything at face value was sold out on Ticketmaster, so we went through a ticket broker website and paid a little more.  We didn't really mind the extra price - the important thing is getting into Madison Square Garden! :)</p>
