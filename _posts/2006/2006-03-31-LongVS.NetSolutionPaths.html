title: "Long VS .Net Solution Paths"
---

<p>This is a joke.  While adding a project to a VS .Net 2005 solution, I encountered this message:</p>  <p><em>"The length of the full path for the solution, project or item you are creating exceeds the maximum path length allowed by the system.  You must reduce the length of the name or the location."</em></p>  <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/toolong.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="500" src="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/TooLong.jpg" alt="Too Long" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>I think this piggybacks on an <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/11/10/1167.aspx">earlier post</a> I made last November about solution path lengths in VS .Net 2003.  At least VS .Net is telling developers when the path is too long now.  But why does the length of the path have to matter??  I thought the days of keeping things like variable names, disk footprints, and of all things <em>file paths</em> small were long gone.  What's even stranger is that the length of the project path I was attempting to use was 150 characters.  I would have guessed that it would have been 512 or 1024 or some other nice, big round computer number.</p>  <p>So I guess I'll have to pick a different path for storing my solutions...</p>
