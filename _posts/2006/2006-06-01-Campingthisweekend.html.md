title: "Camping this weekend"
---

<p>Nikki's mom offered to watch Eva for a couple of nights this weekend and give us some time to ourselves.  It's quite a generous offer :)  </p>
  
<p>So, we decided we'd go camping this weekend with our free time.  We haven't been camping in over a year because last summer Nikki was pregnant and she just wasn't up for it.  We're really eager to take Eva camping but we're just not ready to take her yet.  I know my friend Chris and his wife Kim took their daughter camping when she was still a little baby, but we're just not that brave :)  Kudos to Chris and Kim for being adventerous.  This summer we'll stick to day-trips with Eva.  </p>
  
<p>Anyway, we're going to Wild River state park, which is on the St. Croix river kinda northeast of the Twin Cities.  It's bad deer tick country, so there'll be no rolling around in the woods naked.  We've been there once before but the weather was kinda bad, so this time we're hoping we can see more of it with nicer weather.</p>
  
<p>Our tent is getting a bit worn down.  It's an old Eureka Timberline.  The sides are stretched and are sagging and has a lot of wear.  We've gotten a lot of mileage out of that tent - both literally and figuratively.  So we looked at new tents this past weekend - trying to keep in mind that we'll have more than just of the two of us in a tent in the near future.  It's weird looking at big tents.  I've always liked small, compact tents that aren't bulky and are easy to carry and store.  That kinda has to change now :)  </p>
  
<p>Anyway, I'm pretty excited to go this weekend.  Nothing like smelling like smoke after sitting by a fire for a few days! </p>
