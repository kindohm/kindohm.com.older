title: "Zyuzin hit"
---

<p>I was at the Wild game on Tuesday night and saw this hit on Andrei Zyuzin (see video link below).  It was really tough to watch.  After he got hit he crumpled to the ice and was kicking his legs vigorously in pain.  When he lifted his head off the ice a moment later there was a pool of blood, and he crumpled back down.  I've seen guys bleed in hockey before, but not kick and writhe in pain like that.  It was tough to watch.  </p>
  
<p>I heard he ended up needing 50 stitches to close a laceration on his forehead and he has some nerve damage.  </p>
  
<p>The first half of the video focuses on the fight between Mitchell and Doan, but about halfway through it shows a slow motion replay of the hit at a different angle.  </p>
