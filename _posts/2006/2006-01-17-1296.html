<p>My <a target="_blank" href="http://www.halo2basics.com/">Halo2Basics.com</a> site gets about 2000 hits a month, so I figured with all of these damn web sites that I've been launching I might as well take advantage of the traffic and make some coin.  </p> <p>So, I subscribed to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a> a few weeks ago and put some advertising on the H2 Basics site.  So far I'm not to impressed.  I've had one click for $0.06.  But what's interesting is that the advertisements are kinda-sorta-relevant in a certain way.  While I write this, these are the current ads on the site:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sniper Rifles</strong> - Wide array of Airsoft Sniper Rifles Shop for Airsoft Online Today!</li> <li><strong>The Airsoft Gun Warehouse</strong> - Free Shipping! Great deals Guns, Rifles, Gear, Apparel</li> <li><strong>Paintball Sniper Guns</strong> - One Shot-One Kill Destroys Enemy.  Long Boy Paintball Sniper Guns!</li> <li><strong>Tuffpak Guncase</strong> - The Adventure Begins When You Pak!  The ultimate in gun and bow cases.</li> </ul>  <p>Hrm.  Ok, I can see how ads for weapons would show up on the site since the content of the site talks about weapons and combat.  What I was hoping for was ads related to the XBox and Halo game paraphernalia.  </p>  <p>So I guess the general idea that you can't get something for nothing still applies.  If I want to make money off of this, I'll have to put in some effort and work on the content of the site a bit.  </p>
