title: "Game 7"
---

<p>Tonight will mark the end of the 2005 - 2006 NHL season.  It's game seven of the finals, so there will be a champion tonight.  I expressed my doubts about Edmonton earlier, but I think they're going to win.  I don't know how they pulled it together with their backup goaltending, but they did.  Plus, they have the momentum in the series now too.  However, the game is played on the ice and not on my keyboard, so we'll see what actually happens.</p>  <p>Watching the celebration after the game is arguably just as fun as the game itself.  The Stanley Cup is a storied, one-of-a-kind trophy, and it's cool to watch the winning players each hoist it over their heads.  </p>
