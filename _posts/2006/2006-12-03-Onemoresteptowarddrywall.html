title: "One more step toward drywall"

<p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" src="http://www.greengluecompany.com/images/index/greenGlueTubes2.png" width="100" align="right" />Today I purchased four cases of <a href="http://www.greengluecompany.com" target="_blank">Green Glue</a>. It was something I had to get done so that I could start hanging drywall in the studio before the contractors begin their work. It was a big hit in the wallet, but a necessary purchase. In fact, the biggest expenses of our basement are coming up now with drywall and carpet. Everything else we'll be doing ourselves though.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />
