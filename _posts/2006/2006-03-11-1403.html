<p>I'll have to make some posts once we get back home about our trip. We're too busy to sit down and write anything worthwhile or upload 20 MB of pictures a day. Here's a visual quickie from tonight at Times Square:</p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/ts.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Times Square" src="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/ts.jpg" width="400" border="0" /></a></p> <p>Oh, by the way, Planet Hollywood's food is terrible. That was the worst $60 meal we ever had. We would have been better off with a local deli...</p>
