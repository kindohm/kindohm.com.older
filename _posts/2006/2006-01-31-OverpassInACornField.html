title: "Overpass in a cornfield"
---

<p>You may or may not know that the state of Minnesota is <a href="http://projects.dot.state.mn.us/zrc/212/index.html" target="_blank">building a new Highway 212</a> through Eden Prairie, Chanhassen, and Chaska.  Part of the project was completed a few years ago and the new highway terminated in Eden Prairie.  A few months ago they broke ground again and construction started for the remainder of the highway.</p>  <p>Since the 2nd phase began, I've been watching a ridiculous amount of construction traffic make rounds on Pioneer Trail while heading in to work.  In the morning when it's still dark just west of Highway 101 on Pioneer Trail you can see the lights from an enormous line of dump trucks waiting to load up excavated earth.  They've been working out in a farm field, so you can see off in the distance where they've been excavating.  But this morning I actually saw the giant parts of a new concrete overpass in the field.  It was kind of surreal in a way.  I've been driving on that road for three years and suddenly there's this big object out in a cornfield.  Kinda weird. </p>  <p>I'm glad the project is under way though.  It won't be done for a few years, but the area needs the new traffic capacity with all the new housing going up.  </p>
