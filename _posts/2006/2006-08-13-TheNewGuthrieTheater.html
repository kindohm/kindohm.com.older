title: "The New Guthrie Theater"
---

<p>The new <a href="http://guthrietheater.org/" target="_blank">Guthrie Theater</a> opened this summer.  I've heard nothing but rave reviews about the new facility.  While it's a really nice facility I don't really see what people are raving about.</p>  <p>First, there's a cantilever overlook that hangs over the back of the Guthrie.  It's a little terrace that allows guests to take in the "view" of the Mississippi river.  This is probably the single-most talked about feature of the new Guthrie - people say how great the view and the terrace is.  Well, the terrace is tiny, and the view stinks.  Who the hell wants to look at power lines, grain elevators, the freeway, and the industrial-looking locks?  Don't believe the hype - the view isn't that spectacular.  If you want a great view, get out of the city and go somewhere like <a href="http://www.americasroof.com/mn.shtml" target="_blank">Eagle Mountain</a>.</p>  <p>Next, while the new facility is very modern looking, it's very stark and feels more like an airport terminal than a theater.  I personally prefer more modern designs over traditional architecture but it felt very cold.  The old Guthrie had a lot more warmth and intimacy to it, although it was a bit cramped during intermissions.  Obviously since the Guthrie wanted to grow (it tripled the number of stages in the new building), so did it's facility.  You can't be as intimite with a larger building.  I suppose it was a necessary trade off.</p>  <p>It's not so much that I'm ranting about the Guthrie as much as I am about the people who rave about it.  I have this feeling that the ravers are enthusiastic Guthrie patrons and supporters who would eagerly defend everything about the Guthrie no matter what they did.  </p>  <p>I'd much rather see a bold design that is stark and cold than a tame design that is ok.  The new Guthrie is definitely bold.  I like that the building has its own feel without any question.  The colors are deep and dark and I don't know of anything else that looks like the new Guthrie.  While I don't know what people are raving about, it's an interesting place to take in.</p>  <p>Perhaps one of the coolest features was the chainmail curtains they have on the walls of the McGuire Proscenium Stage.  <em>Very</em> bold, and very cool.</p>
