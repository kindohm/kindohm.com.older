<p>Today after settling in to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=25.744561,58.798828&amp;q=hotel+metro+new+york+city&amp;cid=40714167,-74006389,3684709662187374215&amp;li=lmd" target="_blank">our hotel room</a> we decided to take the <a href="http://www.mta.info" target="_blank">subway</a> to lower Manhattan and see the World Trade Center site.  After seeing images on TV so many times, it was weird to actually be there.  Construction is taking place for the new WTC buildings, but it was interesting to see that the facades of many of the buildings around the site are also under construction (I assume due to damage).  </p>

<p>After that we walked around lower Manhattan a bit, visiting Wall St., the New York Stock Exchange, and a view of the Statue of Liberty.</p>
