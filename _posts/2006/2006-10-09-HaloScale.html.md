title: "Halo Scale"

<p><img style="MARGIN: 6px" src="http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/sloftus_scalecomparison/CascadeScaling/HighCharity-scale.gif" width="200" align="right" />There's a <a href="http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/sloftus_scalecomparison/?display=Halo" target="_blank">ridiculously detailed set of scaled images</a> that illustrate the relative size of objects within the <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> universe. The web pages allow you to drill down into more and more levels of relatively sized objects. Everything is included from the Halo ring, the Covenant city of High Charity, and the Pillar of Autumn down to Warthogs, Forerunner structures, and a UNSC medkit.</p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff. I can't imagine how much time was sucked into obtaining the geometries for everything.</p>
  
<p>Interesting how some objects are shown that don't really ever appear entirely visible in the game - such as Gravemind.  Where the heck do these people get that information from (e.g. how do they know that Gravemind is shaped so tall and skinny)?  It's HBO...  full of obsessed fans and there are connections with Bungie, so there must be ways to get it. </p>
