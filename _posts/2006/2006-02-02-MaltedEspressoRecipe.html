title: "Recipe - Malted Espresso"
---

<p>Here's a recipe for my Malted Espresso Latte.  The only catch is that you need an espresso maker:</p> <ol> <li>Approximately four fluid ounces of espresso</li> <li>Approximately four fluid ounces of milk (steamed or just plain)</li> <li>One tablespoon malt powder</li> <li>Mix and enjoy</li> </ol>  <p>Increase the measurements to eight fluid ounces and two table spoons of malt powder for an extra-strong jolt in the morning.  Optionally add a small shot of caramel or hazelnut.  Tweak the measurement proportions to your liking.</p>
