Overall it took longer than I expected. I also learned that I really hate fiberglass. </p> <p>So this is a pretty cool thing. One step closer to being done with the entire basement. Next up I need to build a box around the electrical panel in the music room, which I expect to take about 2 - 4 hours some other day. Then I need to pick up a load of resilient channel for the walls, put that stuff up, and then schedule an inspection. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/tags/soundproofing/" target="_blank">Check out a few other pictures of the insulated room.</a></p>
