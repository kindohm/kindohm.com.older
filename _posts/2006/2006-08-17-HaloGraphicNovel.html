I happened to take a quick browse around <a href="http://halo.bungie.org" target="_blank">HBO</a> and noticed that a lot of fan/halo story speculation has arisen as a result of this new book.  The universe of the <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> story is deep and rich, and I've enjoyed keeping up with it.  This novel supposedly fills in some gaps in the storyline (which spans way outside of the video games).  I'm eager to see what's inside.</p>  <p>On the Halo side of things, I actually hooked up with three friends online last night and we played some matchmade-Team SWAT for a few hours.  SWAT is always fun.  No shields, no motion sensors.  It's a little more like real life :)  Anyway, it was fun to play a few games.  </p>
