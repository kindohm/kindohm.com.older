title: "Advice for do-it-yourself home studio construction"
---

<p><img src="http://www.asharp.com.au/pics/drumroom.jpg" align="right" style="Margin: 5px;" />For the past six months I was planning on writing a tutorial about do-it-yourself "soundproofing" [1]. I decided to write a tutorial because I had come across nothing but useless, incomplete, or poorly-written information out on the internet while researching my home studio construction. I've learned since then that my own knowledge wasn't much better than all of that bad information I had found - given that I installed my own resilient channel upside down. In the last couple of weeks I've come across excellent resources (books and internet) that I wish I had found years ago when I was planning my construction. I've learned more in two weeks than I learned in two years.</p>
<p>So, I've decided to not write the tutorial. There are already good resources out there that I can't really compliment effectively with my own writing. What I will do is help steer other folks in the right direction to the <em>good</em> resources and dispell some myths so that others don't make the same mistakes I do when planning and constructing a home studio. </p>
<p>First, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Home-Recording-Studio-Build-Pros/dp/1598630342/sr=8-1/qid=1161787685/ref=sr_1_1/102-9954182-5971302?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">Home Recording Studio: Build it like the pros</a> by Rod Gervais. Rod explains difficult concepts about sound and construction in a way that makes them easy to understand. The book covers room dimensions, wall angles, wall/floor/ceiling construction, windows, doors, and acoustic treatment. It's $40, and you <strong>will</strong> get a return on your investment if you buy it and read it. I would have saved $150 had I read the book first. Others have saved thousands.</p>
<p>Second, visit John Sayers's <a href="http://www.johnlsayers.com/phpBB2/index.php" target="_blank">Recording Studio Design</a> forum. It's moderated by real professionals, including Rod, the author of the book above. There is already an abundance of "FAQ"-style material on the forum that could potentially answer all of your questions without having to post a new thread. The forum covers the same basic topics as the book: studio design, construction, and acoustic treatment. It also gets into gear (e.g. electronics and wiring).</p>
<p>Here are some myths:</p>
<ul> 
<li>You think you know something about studio construction  </li>
<li>You need commercial sound blocking materials to block sound (rather, 2x4's, drywall, caulk, and planning will likely be enough)  </li>
<li>What you think would make a good sound-blocking treatment is going to work.  Rather, you're probably wrong based on real science and tried-and-true methods that will prove you otherwise. </li></ul> 
<p>An example on that last bullet - I've read a lot of stories of folks who spent thousands of dollars building complex framing systems which they thought would "isolate" their walls from the rest of their house/structure, when in the end they actually made sound translation to the rest of their structure even worse. Those folks never did their homework and went purely on intuition. A specific example of this that Rod provides in his book is the double-wall construction technique: it seems intuitive that for a double-wall, you'd put drywall on both sides of both walls (e.g. four total faces of drywall). This in fact <strong>weakens</strong> the sound-blocking ability of the double wall. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are real resources out there that you need to consult. Don't assume anything. Home studio construction really isn't that hard to accomplish - it just takes some knowledge of the right way to do something.</p>
<p>[1] there is no such thing as "soundproofing", realistically. Any company or person trying to sell something for "soundproofing" is probably trying to peddle a product that doesn't actually work. They haven't done their research and they don't know the science behind blocking sound. Most sound blocking construction can be done without commercial products. </p>
