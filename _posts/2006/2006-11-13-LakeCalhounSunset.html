<p>Check out this gorgeous sunset with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Calhoun" target="_blank">Lake Calhoun</a> in the foreground:</p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/294752533/"><img height="180" alt="110806_16311.jpg" border="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/109/294752533_ed756fb80b_m.jpg" width="240" /></a><br /><em>click to enlarge</em></p> <p>This beautiful scene occurred last Wednesday when it was about 70 degrees on Nov. 8 2006. Nikki, Eva and I met after work for a quick stroll along the lake and caught the sunset among fishers, joggers, ducks, and geese. The reflection in the water is almost perfect except for the small, nearby waves. My favorite part of the picture is the eerie blackness creeping in from the west on the right hand side of the picture.</p>
