title: "Basement Rough-In Inspection - Done"
---

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/DeWalt_circular_saw.jpeg/200px-DeWalt_circular_saw.jpeg" align="right" style="margin: 5px;" />Yes.  This is huge.  This is a major milestone.  I am <em><strong>so</strong></em> happy that my basement's rough-in inspections passed today.</p>
  
<p>The inspector left me with a <em>very</em> small list of minor things to take care of that I can get done in about five minutes.  Other than that, I can start drywall whenever I'm ready.</p>
  
<p>There was a point at which the inspector was questioning my use of vapor barriers in the studio and started by saying I'd need to tear down all the insulation I put in, but he backed off after I told him that I had already called the city twice before starting insulation to make sure I was doing it right.  He basically said "ok" and left it at that.  That seemed kind of strange to me, but I'm not going to tear down an entire room's worth of insulation if I don't have to.</p>
  
<p>Now, the only question is when to start drywall.  Between now and the end of the year, I think we'll only be at home for a few weekends.  Yep, it's already that crazy and it's not even November yet.  I want to get some estimates from contractors on mudding and taping first too.  Optimistically I should be able to get drywall done before 2007.  We shall see.  </p>
