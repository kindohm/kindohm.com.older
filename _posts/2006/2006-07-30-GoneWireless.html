title: "Gone Wireless"

<p>I picked up one of these Mac-looking [1] suckers today at Micro Center:</p> <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009W8M8Q/sr=8-2/qid=1154316040/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-0220614-9539844?ie=UTF8" target="_blank"><img alt="WAP" border="0" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B0009W8M8Q.01-A9B09ZK9BZJQ6._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1121796073_.jpg" width="200" /></a></p> <p>Yes, I finally got wireless in my house. It's been at least a year overdue if not more. More and more often I wish I could roam around the house with the laptop, and I'm especially noticing it more now when I want to do something quick on the internet while watching Eva away from the hard-line connections.</p>  <p>The speed is great so far but I haven't really tested its limits yet.  I'm sitting right next to it :)</p>  <p>Configuring the thing was pretty easy. I wanted a WAP as opposed to a wireless router because I already have a router in the basement. I basically gave up a hard line connection for the WAP to plug in to. I'm planning on adding at least one more computer to the network in the future, which will require either a bigger router or a new switch or something. The bigger the better, because then I can host LAN parties and allow people to plug into the walls rather than run 50' long cables across the house. Schaweet.</p>  <p>[1] They should have named it an iWAP.  It looks like something straight out of a Mac store.</p>
