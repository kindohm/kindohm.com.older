title: "What to do with all these dang websites"
---

<p>I have too many websites. Some were whipped up to have a little fun with development and to see how much traffic I could generate, others are large apps with lots of data, and others I'm "hosting" for other folks. I can't do much about the stuff I'm hosting for other people, and those sites don't cost me anything anyway. All of the other sites begin to add up over time though. e.g. $30/year for the domain, plus $15/year to host an additional domain with my web host. </p> <p>I'm thinking of dumping three of my domains and their associated sites:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.halo2namegen.com" target="_blank">Halo2NameGen.com</a>  </li><li><a href="http://www.halo2basics.com" target="_blank">Halo2Basics.com</a>  </li><li><a href="http://www.virtualpuck.com" target="_blank">VirtualPuck.com</a> </li></ul> <p>Eliminating these sites and domains would free up $135 a year that I could spend on something else such as a new mixer, recording software, recording PC, materials for our basement, or a lot of rubber chickens. I just have little interest in keeping those sites around. The two <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> sites require 0% of my time to run and maintain. VirtualPuck.com requires a LOT of my spare time, and honestly the site has been dead for a few months. It's too bad because the virtualpuck.com season was so close to ending. Maybe I'll finish it up sometime soon... a multi-month break between playoff series games is ok, right? The main time commitment with virtualpuck.com is writing the content. I just have so many other things I'd rather do.</p> <p>I might as well try and sell the domains, although I doubt I'd get much for them. Halo 2 isn't as popular as when it first came out, and who the heck would want virtualpuck.com?</p>
