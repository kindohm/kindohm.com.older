<p><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news;_ylt=Artjj7LGnWXFyNtobt7bK09H2bYF?slug=ap-wild-lemaire&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns" target="_blank">Wild sign coach Lemaire to extension</a></p>  <p><em>"Lemaire said he had no hesitation about wanting to stay with the franchise he helped build."</em></p>  <p>I was happy to see that in the article.  You don't really hear from the Wild's front office what the coaches think about their jobs and how happy they are.  I'm glad to see that Jacques is happy with his job and the team.</p>  <p>This'll be big for the Wild as they continue to build and groom draft picks.  Lemaire is a great hockey teacher and the Wild will need that kind of approach to coaching in their first decade.</p>
