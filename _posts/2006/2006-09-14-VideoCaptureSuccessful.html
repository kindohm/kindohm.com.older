<p>Well, that was pretty damn easy.

Not sure what the trick is to get a good-quality video on YouTube. On my own machine I captured the raw video at a pretty high resolution... so I'm pretty happy with my new little device. </p> <p><span style="COLOR: red">EDIT:</span> <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/videos/halo%20test_0001.wmv">Download the higher-quality WMV version</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_ahi6HHMsQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_ahi6HHMsQ</a></p> <object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0_ahi6HHMsQ" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0_ahi6HHMsQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>
