The first thing we did after walking in was get some corn dogs.  An army of my family from Duluth came down to the fair too so we hooked up with them around noon, rode the giant slide, got some malts, watched the parade, and then just meandered around a bit. </p>  <p>We actually saw Minnesota hockey legend <a href="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13821" target="_blank">Lou Nanne</a> walking around on the street.  I don't think I'd call it a brush with fame at all but it was fun to see him among the crowd.</p>  <p>We had dinner with my parents, then walked up to see <a href="http://www.leejsackett.com" target="_blank">my friend Lee</a> and his display of tractors.  This is the 2nd year he's shown off his work, and he does an excellent job of tractor restoration.  </p>  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/225143009/" title="Photo Sharing"><img align="left" style="margin: 5px;" border="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/84/225143009_389ffbb34f_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="The Hodnicks at the Fair" /></a>Around 7:30 or so we hooked up with Nikki's parents, rode with Eva on the carousel by the grandstand, had more food, and walked around the midway for a while.  If you're adventurous and like the crazy rides, check out the Space Roller down at the very end of the midway.  I don't think I've ever seen people get whipped around up in the air so fast.  It looked like a blast to ride.  </p>  <p>If you go to the MN state fair this year, I'd highly recommend getting some of those chocolate chip cookies that you get in a little paper cone container.  They are fantastic.  And a few corn dogs too.</p>
