title: "Electrical Work Update"
---

<p>In the past week I've put in about five hours worth of work in the basement.  That's more than what I've put in the past five months.  I thought on Sunday I'd get everything done I wanted to, but I spent some time working last night too.  Basically I'm getting everything in order for the rough-in electrical inspection.  The major items were getting the new circuits I was working with un-hooked from the main electrical panel and taking down old temporary circuits.  The electrical panel was a rat's nest of tangled cables from the previous work that I'd been doing, so it's nice to have that all neat and tidy now.</p> <p>I'm still not ready.  All of the electrical stuff is done, but I want to have the space looking decent for the inspector.  I'd like to leave a good impression on him so that he thinks I have my act together and am not messy and careless.  So tonight I need to vacuum the entire space and throw away a ton of garbage.  I also need to print out the circuit diagram that details what I've done on paper.  Unfortunately, I've deviated from the plan, so I'll need to figure out if iI want to update the plan to fit what I've done or just add some notes on the changes.  I created the diagram in Visio so it's not like I need to re-write it all by hand.  But if there are minimal changes then I might just leave it as-is and make some notes to explain the changes.</p>  <p>I'm preparing myself for the worst.  In reality I think the "worst" would be that I'd have to re-run a few cables.  The inspector might also have some concerns that I've had everything hooked up already, even though I've stripped it all down.  Can't do anything about that though...  We'll see what he says.  I'm pretty curious.  The inspector will only come out on the same day that you call, so assuming I finish up tonight I'll him first thing tomorrow morning and schedule the inspection.  This'll be a huge milestone in the project once it's done.</p>
