The game site is <a href="http://www.halowars.com" target="_blank">www.halowars.com</a>, and Bungie's announcement is <a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?link=bungieatx06" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  
<p>There's also a sweet trailer for the game at <a href="http://www.halowars.com/trailer.html" target="_blank">http://www.halowars.com/trailer.html</a>.  The trailer wasn't rendered on the 360, but it's still pretty awesome.  The shot of the Elite is excellent.</p>
  
<p>The game is based on the first human battles with the Covenant.  Bungie is involved with the game (although they're not developing it), so I'm assuming that some gaps in the Halo universe story might get filled in the game - although for an RTS I'm not sure how much detail they'll actually provide, if any at all.</p>
  
<p>This'll be a 2nd reason to pick up a 360 :)</p>
