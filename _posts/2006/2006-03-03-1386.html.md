title: "Hat tip to Jake"

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.thoughtstoblog.com" target="_blank">Jake</a>, I now have a new home for hosting my mp3s.  He hooked me up with a ridiculous amount of disk space on Dreamhost at <a href="http://kindohm.developstuff.com" target="_blank">kindohm.developstuff.com</a>.  Now I can put my <a href="http://wss.kindohm.com" target="_blank">WSS site</a> to death at last.  I'd never recommend <a href="http://www.webhost4life.com" target="_blank">my host</a> for WSS hosting.  Their WSS sites are terribly slow.  I'm seeing upwards of 2.6 MB/s download speeds with Dreamhost, as opposed to 34 KB/s with the old WSS site.  I'll be changing the links to the files soon.  Who knows what else I'll be throwing up there now that I have some space!</p>
