title: "Basement ready for inspection"
---

<p>I just scheduled an inspection for the basement next Monday 10/30/2006.  This is a huge milestone - I've been working for this day for about two and a half years.  It really should have been less than that, but I'm a slacker with too many hobbies.  Unfortunately, my biggest hobby is really being hindered by the fact that the basement isn't done, so lately I've had a lot more motivation to finish it.  </p>
  
<p>This past weekend I tore down all the RC from the walls, put up the remaining required fire blocking in the frames, and added some insulation up in the joists by the house exterior.  Now I just need to clean up and make things look pretty for Mr. Inspector.  </p>
  
<p>Assuming that everything goes well with the inspection (which from what I know from other people's projects will not be the case), I could be done with drywall in early November.  I need to seek out some mudding/taping contractors, and I'm curious to see if their rate for also hanging drywall isn't much more on top of mudding/taping.  If it's not, then I might contract out <em>all</em> of the drywall work.  However I doubt that'll be the case.  After drywall I'm not sure what'll be next.  Painting, doors, and bath fixtures come to mind.  Then trim and flooring.  Happy happy, joy joy.</p>
