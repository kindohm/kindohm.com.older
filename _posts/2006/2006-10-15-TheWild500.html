Their first road game is in a few days and we'll see how well they fare outside the XCel Energy Center. </p> <p>I've seen three of the five games so far this season and there is a completely different atmosphere about the team this year. Now that the Wild has some firepower, the expectations are different. In my opinion, three out of the four lines on the team have a good chance of scoring any time that they're on the ice - whereas in the past the scoring was primarily limited to Brian Rolston and Marian Gaborik. Gaborik, Rolston, Demitra, Parrish, Pierre-Marc Bouchard, Mikko Koivu and Todd White are all forwards who can make plays and score. They all show offensive flair and feed off each other's talent. This was hardly the case last year when you just hoped for a strong effort and 100% heart.</p> <p>The defensemen are pitching in too. Petteri Nummelin (a.k.a. Pete) and Kim Johnsson are two new defensement this year and they are solid on the blue line but can also get creative with the puck. I didn't realize that former Wild defensemen like Kuba were that "average" until I saw Pete and Johnsson play.</p> <p>The fans this year aren't leaving early. The building stays full to the end and fans stay for the 3-star announcements. They're cheering louder and longer. Every time Demitra or Gaborik touches the puck the crowd buzzes a bit. Everyone can feel that this team has begun a new chapter and dare I say it we can't wait for the playoffs this year. </p>
