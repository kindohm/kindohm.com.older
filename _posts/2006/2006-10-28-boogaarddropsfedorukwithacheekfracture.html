title: "Boogaard drops Fedoruk with a cheek fracture"
---

<p>I think fighting in the NHL should be banned because it's stupid, but on the other hand, hockey fights can be fun to witness. The rumor is that Boogaard gave Fedoruk multiple cheek fractures with his right-hander to Fedoruk's face on Friday night:</p> <object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-vp5ETFvwos" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-vp5ETFvwos" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object> <p>Why oh why would you seek out a fight with Boogaard? If you've been watching the Wild this season, then you know that Boogaard is doing a great job of antagonizing the other team within the rules and getting opposing players pissed off. Other players want to get back at him, and most of the time he'll just smile and laugh while they throw a punch, and they get a penalty while he keeps his cool. But some nights if he's in the mood he'll throw punches back. This game was obviously one of those nights :)</p>  <p class="tags">tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/nhl" target="_blank" rel="tag">nhl</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hockey" target="_blank" rel="tag">hockey</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wild" target="_blank" rel="tag">wild</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/boogaard" target="_blank" rel="tag">boogaard</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fedoruk" target="_blank" rel="tag">fedoruk</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fight" target="_blank" rel="tag">fight</a>  </p>
