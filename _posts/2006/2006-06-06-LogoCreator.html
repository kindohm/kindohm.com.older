<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www.logoyes.com" target="_blank">LogoYes.com</a> today, a site that lets you design a business logo right on their site and if you buy it (for $99) you receive all the gifs and jpgs - plus options for business cards and stuff.  Here's a sample:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/hodnick01.jpg" alt="Hodnick Logo 1" /></p> <p><img src="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/hodnick02.jpg" alt="Hodnick Logo 2" /></p>  <p>It's a cool site if you're a small business and don't have the resources for a graphic designer.  I whipped up my logos in about 60 seconds.  It's also dangerous too...  I'm a guy who believes in good branding and design, and it'd be so easy for someone who doesn't know what they're doing to create a really, really lame logo.  It's a great tool, but an unskilled small business owner could really do some damage to themselves.  LogoYes.com thought of that already though - if you pay more up front, you can re-design you logo as many times as you want with no more fees.</p>
