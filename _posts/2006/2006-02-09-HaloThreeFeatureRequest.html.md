title: "Halo 3 feature request"
---

<p>Halo 2 stats online through XBox live was really cool.  It STILL is really cool.  But I usually play with people I know more in person rather than online.  A lot of my Halo 2 buddies don't subscribe to XBox live, and big group games with my friends are usually played in person at LAN parties (as opposed to meeting friends online).  None of the stats for local LAN games are recorded anywhere.  A game's stats are viewable only immediately after it has finished.  To my non-XBox live buddy, I have no way to say "I always have <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">better standardized test scores</span> more kills than you!!"</p>
  
<p>Now I don't know much about the XBox 360 hardware, so I don't know how possible this is...  but wouldn't it be cool if you could export a game's stats to an external device (e.g. a USB drive)?  Or even better, Halo 3 should be able to keep a history of the stats of all local LAN games and then allow you to export or upload (e.g. ftp site) them somewhere.  That way for my elite clique of non-online Halo 2'ers we could maintain our own set of stats for fun.</p>
