title: "Basement Post-Inspection Next Steps"
---

<p>Tomorrow afternoon the city inspector is stopping by to inspect the small changes I had to make.  After that it's all on me to keep making progress.</p>
  
<p>Tentatively I'm thinking I'll put up drywall the 2nd weekend in December.  That's about the only weekend we have free between now and the holidays, and I REALLY want to get the drywall done before then.  There are a good number of tasks I need to get done in order for that to happen - like contacting mud/tape contractors, get the drywall purchased/delivered, and finalize my communication panel in the closet under the stairs [1].  Oh yeah, I also need to buy three cases of <a href="http://www.greengluecompany.com" target="_blank">Green Glue</a>.</p>
<p>[1] I completely forgot about the communication panel until this weekend.  This panel is where all the coax, phone, and CAT-5 cable in the house gets routed.  Since I'd like to have a neat place for all the home networking, I need to create some in-wall outlets to plug the CAT-5 cable into.  That means getting my wires cut to size and installing some low-voltage boxes in the closet walls.  Had I forgotten about this until after drywall was done, I would've had to rip open the walls.  </p>
