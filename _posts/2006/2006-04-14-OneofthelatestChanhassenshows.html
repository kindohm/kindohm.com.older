title: "The Musical of Musicals - The Musical"
---

<p>I highly recommend going to see <em>The Musical of Musicals: The Musical</em> at the Chanhassen Dinner Theater if you live in the Twin Cities area.  It's in one of their smaller theaters (not the big stage) and there are only four actors, so it's a bit more intimate (which I generally prefer).  </p>  <p>Anyway, this show parodies and makes fun of shows like Phantom, Music Man, Oklahoma, etc.  It was absolutely crazy and hilarious.  Totally bizarre in a funny way in some parts.  There were a lot of older folks in the audience, and personally I don't think they really enjoyed a lot of the humor.  It was insane at times.  </p>  <p>So, go see it if you're looking for something to do.  I'm not sure if you <em>have</em> to buy dinner <em>and</em> the ticket to the show or if you can just get a ticket to the show.  The food is ok...  but if you're planning on eating dinner anyway then the price is comparable to dinner and a similar show elsewhere.  </p>
