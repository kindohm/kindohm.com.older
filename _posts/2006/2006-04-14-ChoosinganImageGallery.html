title: "Choosing an Image Gallery"
---

<p>Right now I'm hosting all kinds of images on my site using <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/ngallery">nGallery</a>.  Frankly, I dislike using it.  It's slow and difficult to maintain data.  Plus it stores images on my website's file system, so I need to pay for extra disk space as I add more and more images.</p>  <p><a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> has an image gallery feature that's much simpler and easier to use, but it doesn't provide a lot of the features that nGallery has.  I don't think Subtext really cuts it either.</p>  <p>So I'm going to start playing around with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.  Flickr has been around for a <em>relatively</em> long time but I never really paid much attention to it.  So far I like it because I don't have to pay for the storage, the organizing features are nice, and unlike nGallery it releases cool new stuff every so often.  Multiple-file uploading using their upload tool is also really easier to use than nGallery's multiple-file upload feature.</p>  <p>So off I go into the world of Flickr.  I'm curious to know what other people's thoughts are on using it for their image storing/sharing and how they've liked it.</p>
