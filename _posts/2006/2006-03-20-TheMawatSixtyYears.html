title: "The Maw at Sixty Years"
---

<p>On Sunday I had the pleasure of watching my dad play the last two scenes of "The Maw" from <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a>: Combat Evolved.  Normally this wouldn't be anything to be very excited about, but this is a 60-year old guy <em><strong>finishing</strong></em> his <em><strong>first</strong></em> FPS game ever.  I've said it before:  I think it's really cool that my dad enjoys video games so much - let alone playing Halo in its entirety.  </p> <p>Granted, it's a little hard watching him play.  He's played through the entire game on easy, and it's kinda painful to see him just stand motionless in the middle of the engineering room of the Pillar of Autum, get wailed on up close by three Flood attack forms, then proceed to still kill them and walk away with more than 50% health.  Kinda funny :)  It's so hard not to interrupt him every other second and tell him what to do :) But it's pretty cool.  Maybe he'll join us at the next LAN party ;) </p>
