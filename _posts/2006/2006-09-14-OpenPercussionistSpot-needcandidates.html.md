title: "Open Percussionist Spot - need candidates"
---

<p>The <a href="http://www.medalistband.org" target="_blank">Medalist</a> wind ensemble is looking to fill a vacancy in its percussion section for this fall/winter/spring season.  If you or someone you know are interested, pleast contact me through the site.  Medalist is a volunteer, community band.  </p>
  
<p>When people hear "community band", they think of a group of people who get together on the bed of trailer at the state fair and play in a parade.  Not the case here - Medalist is actually a top-notch volunteer group.  It's about as good as you can get for a non-professional group.  I have no idea if anyone out there will really read this <em>and</em> be interested... but if so, don't let the "community band" thing turn you away.  </p>
  
<p>We're looking for an well-rounded percussionist who can play everything.  Right now there are three of us who are all pretty experienced.  I doubt there'll be an audition.  </p>
  
<p>There are a few guys I'm trying to track down that I know would fit what we're looking for, but I haven't seen them for years and wouldn't know where to start other than a Google search.  Please spread the word if you're in music circles or know someone who is a percussionist.</p>
