title: "A tale of two blogs"
---

<p>I've started blogging on <a href="http://blogs.inetium.com/blogs" target="_blank">Inetium's blog server</a> (<a href="http://blogs.inetium.com/blogs/mhodnick" target="_blank">http://blogs.inetium.com/blogs/mhodnick</a>, <a href="http://blogs.inetium.com/blogs/mhodnick/rss.aspx" target="_blank">RSS</a>).  I see value in blogging for Inetium, but I don't want to give up posting technical content on my personal site either.  I also want to avoid cross-posting because I want both "blogs" to be as valuable as they can on their own.</p>  <p>Thus, my plan is to use my Inetium blog for a narrower scope of topics such as WinFX and <a title="WPF" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/" target="_blank">WPF</a> and any other work-related content.  I'll keep using my personal site for any personal development projects outside of work (not that I have any right now) and non-work-related content.  </p>
