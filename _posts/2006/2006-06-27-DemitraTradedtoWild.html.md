<p><img src="http://pics.forecaster.ca/nhl-player/0453.gif" align="right" alt="Pavol Demitra" />So, <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/player_bio.asp?player_id=453" target="_blank">Pavol  Demitra</a> now plays for the Wild. Glad to see that Doug Risebrough (Wild  GM) is making some moves to help the team win more <em>now</em> than just  waiting for prospects to develop. I was going to write a post about how I  figured the Wild would make a trade and sign some bigger name free agents this  off season, but draft day beat me to it.</p>
<p>I've always agreed with the Wild's strategy of building through the draft and  developing prospects first over going for established talent. That's exactly  what the Wild are doing here though - they've believed in building through the  draft and this is really the first time in their 5 year history where they've  given up a future prospect for established talent. I don't see this as straying  from their plan. They're complimenting their solid, developing core of young  players. </p>
<p>By building through the draft, you also build up a store of prospects you can  deal later. This is exactly what the Wild did to land Demitra - they traded  away the offensively talented prospect <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/player_bio.asp?player_id=2805" target="_blank"> Patrick O'Sullivan</a>. It was a hard pill to swallow seeing O'Sullivan go,  but that's the decision Dougie made. Personally I would've been willing to  wait, see O'Sullivan develop and do without Demitra. Demitra is 31 and the Wild  won't be able to hang on to him as long as O'Sullivan at 21. O'Sullivan would  have been a better deal in the long run if he turned out to be a good player.  Demitra will help in the short (and medium?) term and has already established  himself as a good player. It's a trade off but overally I think the Wild will  benefit more from the trade.</p>
<p>Fans are going to be happy because Demitra will provide that much-needed  offensive spark to push the Wild into the playoffs next year, and Demitra will  also help keep Gaborik on the team. Rumors are spreading that Gaborik is going  to negotiate hard on his contract again like he did a few years back, and  Demitra will be a huge incentive to keep him on the team and perhaps keep him  affordable for the Wild (not that the Wild are in a financial pinch). </p>
