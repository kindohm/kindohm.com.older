title: "Letter to WebHost4Life CEO"
---

<p>WebHost4Life allows anyone to send an email to their CEO, so I sent one regarding the password strength issue I posted about this morning:</p> <div style="padding: 0px 30px; font-family: Courier New;"> <p>Dear Sir or Madame -</p> <p>Why doesn't WebHost4Life support strong passwords for their FTP service? Please take a look at this article that I posted this morning:</p> <p><a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2006/05/02/Limitedpasswordcharacters-timeforanewwebhost.aspx">Link</a></p> <p>When I attempted to change my FTP password to a "strong" password that uses non-alphanumeric characters, I received the message saying that I could only use numbers and letters for the password. In this day and age of Internet security I am shocked that WebHost4Life doesn't support stronger passwords and I am concerned for the security of my FTP site. I have friends and colleagues who have had their FTP sites compromised by hackers even with strong passwords. </p> <p>In addition, passwords are displayed in clear text on your control panel's screens. I've noticed this when changing passwords for email and FTP users. Why aren't the passwords masked so that their value is hidden from the screen? Again, this is a fundamental browser security feature that almost all membership sites use.</p> <p>I'm considering canceling my account unless you can assure me that steps will be taken soon to address this issue. I've recommended friends and colleagues to your service in the past but will discontinue to do so until these features of your service are secured.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Mike Hodnick<br />http://www.kindohm.com </p></div> <p>I'm curious to see if I'll actually get a response.</p>
