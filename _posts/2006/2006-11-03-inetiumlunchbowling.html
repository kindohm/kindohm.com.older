<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/287959223/"><img style="MARGIN: 5px" height="240" alt="Friends%20200" border="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/118/287959223_52f70b53c5_m.jpg" width="180" align="right" /></a>Thanks to Tim (who doesn't have a blog or site that I know of to link to) for organizing an Inetium office bowling outing during lunch today. I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/sets/72157594359235782/" target="_blank">posted all the pictures out on Flickr</a>. </p> <p>Pizza, jalapeno poppers, bowling, and coworkers. What else could you ever want? Hrm, I guess I'd be lying if I said I didn't also want an alpaca.</p> <p>Everybody should do this. It's cheap and it's fun, unless you don't like your coworkers. In that case, it'd be cheap and annoying. But like I always say, a good game of bowling outweighs an afternoon with annoying coworkers. And in my case, my coworkers aren't annoying. And I don't really know how much they weigh, so I hope the scale is big enough.</p><br />
