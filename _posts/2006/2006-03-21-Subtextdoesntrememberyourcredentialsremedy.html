title: "Subtext doesn&#39;t remember your credentials - remedy"
---

<p>After doing my .Text upgrade, I've noticed that <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> hasn't been able to remember my login credentials whenever I log in to my site. In Firefox I viewed the cookies for kindohm.com and found a bunch of "Dottext" cookies from the old site. I figured that maybe there was a conflict between cookies somehow and deleted all of the cookies for kindohm.com. That did the trick - now my credentials are remembered across sessions. So you if you converted to Subtext and are having the same problem, delete your cookies from IE or just remove your site's cookies within Firefox. That should do it.</p>
