<p>...they give you your own website at the age of eight months.  That's right....  <a href="http://www.evajoy.net" target="_blank">EvaJoy.net</a> has launched.  We thought it'd be really cool to get a domain name for Eva and let her take charge of it when she gets old enough.  Who knows, maybe she will hate computers and technology when she grows up, but until then she'll have her own site maintained by mom and dad. </p>  <p>I couldn't just create a static site...  I had to do something a <em>little</em> cool by having the site pull content from an Atom feed generated from Blogspot so that content can be syndicated.  Ok, so none of our relatives even have a clue what Atom, RSS, blogs, or syndication is.  But like I said, I couldn't just create a static site.  Where would the fun be in <em>that</em>?</p> <br /><br /><br /><br />
