<p>The 1st floor men's bathroom in the office where I work is having some maintenance done in it.  I never really stopped to look at a hand-written sign that was posted inside, but <a href="http://iwkid.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Raymond</a> had taken a closer look and pointed out that it was kinda funny.  Don't ask why I had a camera handy in the bathroom, but I couldn't help but take a picture:</p>

<p>I guess reading and writing skills weren't a requirement when they were interviewing for the custodial job :)</p>
