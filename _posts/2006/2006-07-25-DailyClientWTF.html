<p>If you're a developer, you've probably heard of or visited <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Daily WTF</a>. It's a site where developers can post really poor code that they've come across for the development community to laugh about. I swear, someone needs to come up with TheDailyClientWTF.com.</p> <p>Here's the scenario:</p> <p><em>Customer: "Hey Mike, can we have the News list removed from the News and Events page of the website? We only use the Events items and the News list is always empty." <br /><br /> Mike: "Sure no problem. I'll remove the list for the next deployment." <br /><br /> [Mike deletes the control from the News and Events page and deploys the code]  <br /><br /> Customer: "Mike we're really going to need your help on this one. Whenever we create new News items, they aren't showing up on the News and Events page of the website. Can you look in to it.<br /><br /> [must.....control......fist.....of......death....] </em></p> <p>You can't make this stuff up.</p>
