<p>Yikes - the first eastern-conference NHL playoff game with Buffalo facing Ottawa was crazy. Buffalo won 7-6 in overtime. I thought Ottawa would maintain their high standard of defense, but either they were lazy or Buffalo's offense is just that good. I think Buffalo's offense is just that good. Both Ottawa and Buffalo have scored the most goals in this season's playoffs. </p> <p>I'm rooting for Ottawa this post season, and <a href="http://www.justaddcode.com/blog" target="_blank">Neil</a> says I'm anti-American. He thinks I go home after work and wrap myself up in a big maple leaf. That's not true - but I do spend time admiring the Canadian mountie posters on my wall.</p>
