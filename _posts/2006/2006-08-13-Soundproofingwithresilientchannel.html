title: "Soundproofing with resilient channel"
---

<p>Today I gave my first shot at putting resilient channel (RC) up in the soundproof room. It was a little tricky at first because the RC is manufactured with 4" holes (e.g. for 16" spaced studs), but a lot of the studs in the basement room aren't 16" apart. Thus, there was a bit more planning that I had to do. </p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/214358362/"><img height="180" alt="Resilient channel partially installed in soundproof room" src="http://static.flickr.com/76/214358362_13b9475fe1_m.jpg" width="240" /></a><br /><em>The RC partially hung in the room</em></p> <p>Perhaps the most fun part about the RC is cutting it. Sparks everywhere. Madness, I tell you. I'm hoping to have Nikki take a picture while I'm cutting it. It's quite a feeling having red-hot metal shards land on top of a freshly shaved head.</p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/214358462/"><img height="180" alt="Resilient channel and frame cross section" src="http://static.flickr.com/59/214358462_8d69ec3d48_m.jpg" width="240" /></a><br /><em>Cross section of the RC on a frame</em></p> <p>It's also neat to see how the RC will work and how it will provide separation of the drywall from the frames (see cross section photo above for an example).</p> <p>The only bad part about this is that it's more tedious than I thought it'd be. A lot of the pieces need to be custom cut (e.g. I can't just bulk cut a whole bunch of pieces for an entire wall) because there are non-standard stud spaces and random things like door frames and electrical boxes that cause variation. I'd be more efficient if I could get someone to cut while I measure and hang the RC. "Hey [friend's name], want to come over and help with my basement? Free pizza and beer!?" "Oh, no thanks, I'd rather just stay home and order some."</p>
