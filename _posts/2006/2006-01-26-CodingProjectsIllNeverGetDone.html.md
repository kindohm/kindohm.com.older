<p>Maybe if there were 48 hours in an earth day I'd have more time:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Write my own blog engine.  I've been using .Text for about a year and a half to power this site.  It's fast and reliable, and I love the skinning capabilities.  But it's not perfect, and it's not valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional.  There are some quirks about the posting options that I dislike, it doesn't support tagging, and there are some limitations to skinning.</li>  
<li>Explore the world of <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/experience/#wpfpt">WPF</a>.  I'd just like to become more knowledgable about this technology in general.  </li>  
<li>Revive my <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/07/11/1001.aspx">demographics project</a>.  It'll be a little easier to work on now that VS 2005 is out and there are new WinFX bits out.  I think this project could be really cool...  there's opportunimty for performing a ton of lightweight visual analysis on local and national demographic data.  Something like this might already be able to be accomplished with something like Google Maps or Google Earth, but what fun would that be?</li>  
<li>Construct and launch www.AreYouTwins.com.  This is something that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justaddcode.com">Neil</a> suggested doing during lunch yesterday after I talked about a hypothetical scenario that I won't get into just yet.  The problem with this project is that it would involve a lot of time filming and compiling video.  The domain name is registered though.  Thanks for the idea Neil.  </li>  
<li>Get virtualpuck.com off of its face.  I'm not even sure I'm going to keep this site alive, but the problem is that it's a dog.  It's slow.  In short, the way that the site obtains statistical data about players (e.g. shot percentage, goals against per game, etc) is not optimal.  I already know what the better architecture would be, but I just need time to work on it.</li>  
</ol>
