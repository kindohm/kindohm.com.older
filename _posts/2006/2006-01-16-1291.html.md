<p>Assuming you didn't die of heat exhaustion from the earth's core first, you'd probably drown if you dug to the other side of the earth from Chaska.</p>

<p>You can dig to the other side of the earth using the <a target="_blank" href="http://grad.icmc.usp.br/~cipriani/bighole.php">Dig to the Other Side of the Earth Google Maps mashup</a>.  I got to this mashup from <a target="_blank" href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/">googlemapsmania.blogspot.com</a> after hearing about it on MPR the other day.</p>
