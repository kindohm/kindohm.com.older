title: "New Sabres Logo"
---

<p>Why oh why did the <a href="http://www.buffalosabres.com" target="_blank">Buffalo Sabres</a> change their logo? They got rid of the best logo in the NHL.</p> <p>Old logo:</p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img src="http://www.news10nbc.com/gfx/240/1146.jpg" /></p> <p>New logo:</p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img src="http://cdn.nhl.com/img/team/buf100.gif" /></p> <p>Now, I think the new logo is pretty sharp, but how could you do away with the satanic-looking buffalo with the red eyes??!! They had the scariest logo in all of sports, and now it's nothing but history. At least they don't have their logo from TWO jerseys' ago:</p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img src="http://www.buffalorising.com/home/archives/sabres%20logo-thumb.gif" width="200" /></p>
