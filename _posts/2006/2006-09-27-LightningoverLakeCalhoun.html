title: "Lightning over Lake Calhoun"
---

<p>A few weeks ago, Nikki and I were in the uptown area and witnessed some fascinating lighting over Minneapolis.  Unfortunately, this was the same storm that caused tornado damage up in the Rogers, MN area.  But we were able to get some pictures of the lightning over Lake Calhoun.  There are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/tags/lightning/" target="_blank">four pictures here</a>.</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/254540154/" title="Photo Sharing"><img border="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/102/254540154_4763d9765c.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Lightning over Lake Calhoun #1" /></a></p>
