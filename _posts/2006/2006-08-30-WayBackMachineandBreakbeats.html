I had <em>never</em> heard of this before. It's basically a system that takes snapshots of websites at a point in time and permanently archives it. Holy crap. So, I decided to find my old web pages from college. I had numerous designs for my sites ten years ago, and archive.org had indexed one:</p> <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970616142612/http://www.d.umn.edu/~mhodnick/" target="_blank">http://www.d.umn.edu/~mhodnick/</a></p> <p>But that's not even the cool part...</p> <p>While clicking through my old pages, I found that archive.org actually archived a whole bunch of old WAV files that I had posted. Specifically, a series of audio files of me interviewing friends and classmates about their feelings on dirt. Yes, dirt. There's a bunch of other audio I found too. You can view all of the audio at <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/mp3/reallyold/">http://www.kindohm.com/mp3/reallyold/</a>.</p> <p>So, I worked with the <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/mp3/ReallyOld/dirt_nate.wav">dirt_nate.wav</a> sample a bit and stuck it into a new experimental tune that I worked on last night: <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/mp3/Remnants/dirt.mp3">dirt.mp3</a>. It was just a little experiment, but I think it'll turn into a full-fledged tune in the near future. </p>
