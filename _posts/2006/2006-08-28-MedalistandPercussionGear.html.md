title: "Medalist and Percussion Gear"
---

<p>I've decided to re-join <a href="http://www.medalistband.com" target="_blank">Medalist</a> again this Fall. I took the summer off and it was a good break. I wasn't sure that I would come back this Fall, but <a href="http://www.leejsackett.com" target="_blank">Lee</a> is now the new percussion section leader and a few other percussionists have quit, and I think we'll have a really solid section this year full of good players. </p>
<p>I've been looking around for something new to carry around all my percussion gear in. I have a stick bag, but it's not very good for hauling around misc. gear like triangle clamps, papers, music, tuners, or Mad Libs [1]. I came across one of these in my searching for a new bag/case:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002E3GX2/sr=8-4/qid=1156774792/ref=sr_1_4/104-5840764-7523121?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Vic Firth Stick Case</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002E3GX2/sr=8-4/qid=1156774792/ref=sr_1_4/104-5840764-7523121?ie=UTF8" target="_blank"><img alt="Vic Firth Stick Case" src="http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/B0002E3GX2.01-A26YF6IE4OQDOU._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1141188317_.jpg" width="400" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This looks like it'd be pretty decent. This case would hold a lot more crap than my stick bag. It has that fancy stick-tray thing but I doubt I'd use that. </p>
<p>The only downside is that it's $60, and that's a bit steep. I was hoping to find something like an small, old, used hard-shell suitcase, but I couldn't find anything on like eBay that would work. Nikki also suggested buying something like a music instrument case and ripping out its guts to make just a plain case, but it'd still cost about $75 for a generic instrument case. </p>
<p>[1] Mad Libs are handy to have around during rehearsals as a percussionist.  Or, any other reading material or something that can help waste time.  Those 2nd movement TACETS or 124-measure rests absolutely bite as a percussionist.</p>
