<p>You know you've been playing Mad Libs when you hear someone say:</p>
<p><em>"Add milk and dust mites and beat rapidly with an electric claw."</em></p>
<p><em>"After the cake cools, slither it from the bathtub and turn it upside-slippery."</em></p>
<p><em>"Organize all of your Korean deep-sea divers on a piece of nose cartilege."</em></p>
<p><em>"They would rather walk across burning pulleys or swim in handicapped cat-infested waters than give a speach in front of a group of missing suspenders."</em></p>
<p><em>"E-Mail: means suspiciously transmitted pepper spray."</em></p>
<p><em>"Modem: Is the device that allows a bionic computer to transmit hamsters over a phone seaweed."</em></p>
<p> </p>
