<p>I haven't bought a game for the XBox in a long, long time.  This weekend I took Eva on a little trip to Best Buy in search of cheap XBox games.  I find that I'm playing XBox in 5-15 minute increments, so I wanted to find a game that wouldn't require a long attention span.  Plus I wanted to find something cheap since I didn't want to invest $50 in something I would only play a few minutes a day.</p>  <p>So I picked up Project Gotham Racing 2 for $9.  Most people have moved on from that game, but Saturday was the first time I ever played it.  The only racing games I have are for PS2, and I wanted a racing game for XBox anyway.</p>  <p>I also picked up Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.  Ok, it does <em>not</em> satisfy the short-attention-span requirement, but I really wanted an RPG - plus it was only $9 too.  </p>  <p>I don't really have much of an opinion on either of them since I haven't played them too much yet.  But initially I think both are kinda cool.  In the racing genre, I've played a LOT of Gran Turismo, which is like Forza, and PGR2 is nice because the focus is more on racing and not on building up your garage and tuning your cars.  I've barely done anything in Morrowind yet, other than join the Mage's guild :)</p>
