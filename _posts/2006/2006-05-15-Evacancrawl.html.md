title: "Eva can crawl"
---

<p>Eva crawled for the first time today. Head over to <a href="http://www.evajoy.net/" target="_blank">EvaJoy.net</a> to view the video footage. Luckily a video camera wasn't too far away and Nikki was there to catch it.  I think there's a strong chance Eva is going to be a gamer...  in the video you can see that she's going for the XBox wireless controller base :)</p>
<p>We're pretty excited about this. She always gets pretty frustrated because she can't move around and get to where she wants to go. Now that'll start to change, and I'm excited for her.</p>
<p>On the evajoy.net note, I realized I need to get permalinks working on her site. Right now it's just a news feed that just rolls out content. I'll have to work on that sometime...</p>
