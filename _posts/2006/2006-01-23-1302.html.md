title: "Samsung YP-U1X MP3 Player"

<p>I received one of these as a gift this weekend:</p>

<p>It's a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/Products/DigitalAudioPlayer/MP3Players/YP_U1XBXAA.asp" target="_blank">Samsung YP-U1X</a> mp3 player.  I've been wanting a cheap little mp3 player for a while so that I can listen to music while mowing the lawn and stuff like that.  But this one is really cool because it also has a built-in microphone for voice recording.  My old cassettte tape portable recorder was always a hassle to use because it wasn't digital.  For those of you who know me pretty well, you know that I really liked that recorder and got all kinds of interesting sound bites on it.  Now you can expect me to try and catch you saying something stupid again :)  </p>
