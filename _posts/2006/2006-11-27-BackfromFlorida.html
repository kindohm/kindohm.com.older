We were gone for all of Thanksgiving week and it was great to be away from work for a week. Surprisingly I don't get a lot of email... I don't think I had more than 30-40 emails at work to go through, and about 10 personal ones. RSS feed items are a different story though... and I'm at the threshold where I don't even read anything anymore because there's too much stuff to go through. Time to wipe RSS Bandit almost clean again...</p> <p>Anyway, we stayed in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=north+redington+beach,+fl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=13&amp;ll=27.815849,-82.820778&amp;spn=0.111896,0.284615&amp;t=h&amp;om=1" target="_blank">North Redington Beach</a>, which is just a little gulf coast town outside of Tampa. The weather was not typical Florida weather, and the temperatures were around 60 F for most of the week. Nothing that a few sweatshirts can't handle though... instead of spending time on the beach we did other stuff like go to the Tampa zoo. I really don't care for just spending time on the beach anyway. Otherwise by Wednesday it was warming up again and by Thanksgiving day it was well above 70 F.</p> <p>Eva did great on the flights and in an unfamiliar place. She was a little out-of-sorts the entire week because of not being home, but she loved all the new experiences like walking on the beach and playing in the sand.</p> <p>Friday we went to a <a href="http://www.tampabaylightning.com" target="_blank">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> game at the St. Pete Times Forum, where the Lightning hosted the Atlanta Thrashers. It was a great game - but it made us really appreciate how great the Wild's <a href="http://www.xcelenergycenter.com" target="_blank">Xcel Energy Center</a> is. The St. Pete Times Forum is a lot like the Minneaplis Target Center - it's aging a little bit and it was built more as a multi-purpose arena than strictly for hockey. The fans there are great and they love their team. They're arguably louder than us mild-mannered Minnesota fans are. It looked like the almost had a sold-out game there, which speaks volumes about how a winning franchise can make hockey popular in a non-traditional market.</p> <p>On Thanksgiving day we cooked a turkey in our place and had a great dinner with just the five of us. It was kinda weird - I'd have had a Thanksgiving dinner where 1) the weather was warm, 2) there weren't fewer than 10 people, 3) it was relatively quiet while eating, and 4) I had a sunburn. Normally it's cold, there are 2-3 tables of friends and family, and chaotic with kids running around. Breaking tradition is always a good thing! It was an outstanding dinner - Nikki's mom is an awesome cook.</p> <p>It was a good time but I'm also glad to be back home. What's next? Not sure... Nikki and I are throwing around the idea of flying out east (Boston?) for a quick getaway maybe next spring. </p>
