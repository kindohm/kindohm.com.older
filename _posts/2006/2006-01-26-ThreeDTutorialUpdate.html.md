title: "Updated WPF (Avalon) 3D Tutorial"
---

<p>Late last night I fixed up my 3D tutorial for the new CTP release of WinFX.  There really wasn't a lot to change, luckily.  I also removed the tutorial from the confines of my blog engine (.Text) so that it can breathe more easily.  The new tutorial is strictly content without navigation, eye candy, or constraints on content width.  As a result I don't have to worry about the code snippets scrolling.  Plus now it looks more "technical" :)</p>
<p>Anyway, here it is: <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/technical/WPF3DTutorial.htm">http://www.kindohm.com/technical/WPF3DTutorial.htm</a>.</p>
<p>This was the first time I've been back in WPF/Avalon in a while.  It's nice because WinFX and WPF perform so much better now, and VS 2005 has obviously been released too, so it's faster than before.  When I originally wrote the tutorial, I was using a Beta of VS 2005 and a very early build of WinFX - before Avalon was named Windows Presentation Foundation.  Anyway, it flies now, and it's cool.</p>
