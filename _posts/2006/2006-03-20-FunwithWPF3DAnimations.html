title: "Fun with WPF 3D Animations"
---

<p>This week I've been integrating a Trackball component (found in the WinFX examples on <a href="http://therhogue.com/" target="_blank">Robert Hogue's site</a>) and playing with 3D animations in <a title="WPF" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/" target="_blank">WPF</a> apps.  So, you're probably wondering what it looks like when you have a multi-colored matrix of bouncing, spinning cubes.  Well you're in luck:</p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/CubeGrid.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/CubeGrid.jpg" alt="Cube Grid" border="0" /></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/files/CubeGrid.zip">Download the code here.</a></p> <p>In the words of <a title="Raymond" href="http://iwkid.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Raymond</a>: "Necessary?  No.  Cool?  Absolutely."  But seriously...  I'm glad I was able to find some time to get to this little exercise.  While my final product doesn't really provide much value, the knowledge gained in the process can be re-used.  </p>  <p>Also, Hogue's trackball is pretty sweet.  I like it better than the one currently out on GotDotNet.  It's very easy to hook up and I don't see why you wouldn't use it all the time while experimenting with 3D.</p>
