Bertuzzi needed a new environment after his paralyzing hit on Moore. The Canucks had a winning team that went nowhere last season. Florida is plain lousy and needed to make a change. </p> <p>Bertuzzi leaving Vancouver and going to the Eastern Conference means the Wild won't have to face him as much (or at all) any more in the Northwest division, but now they'll have to deal with a better goaltender in Luongo. Luongo is super-human at times in goal, and that won't help the Wild as they'll face him six times during the season. </p>
