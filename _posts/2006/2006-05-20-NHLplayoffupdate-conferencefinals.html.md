title: "NHL playoff update - conference finals"

<p>Well at this point my predictions were all wrong. I expected Colorado to face Calgary in the conference finals, and neither of them made it. Calgary didn't even make it out of the quarter-finals. We're now looking at Anaheim playing Edmonton for the rights to represent the Western Conference. I think Edmonton will win because they skate harder, hit harder, have offense, have outstanding goaltending, and they're riding the wave of momentum after beating San Jose. Anaheim is a great team too but they've had a long break. I think momentum will be the key factor.</p>
<p>In the east, I had all of my semi-final matchups correct, but predicted the wrong winner. New Jersey lost to Carolina and Ottawa lost to Buffalo. I'm still suprised at these results. Ottawa just collapsed. This was their year. New Jersey had what they needed to win but just couldn't pull it off. So now we're looking at Buffalo vs. Carolina. I can't predict with any confidence who'll win this series. Buffalo will sweep in four games because they have the absolute best team logo in the league:</p>

<p>Ahhh, back in the day it didn't get any better when <a href="http://www.nhl.com/players/8459534.html" target="_blank">Satan</a> played for Buffalo with that jersey:</p>

<p>Edmonton will bring the Cup back to Canada in 7 games. Their high-intensity skating will beat the high-powered Buffalo offense.</p>
