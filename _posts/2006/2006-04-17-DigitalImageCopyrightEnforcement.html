title: "Digital Image Copyright Enforcement"
---

<p>         Nikki and I had an interesting thing happen to us this weekend. We took about 60         pictures of Eva using a makeshift background with a purple bedsheet, then moved         the pictures from the camera's memory card to our hard drive. Then we burned a CD,         went to Walgreens, and got them developed. The next day, we wanted to pick out a         couple of the pictures that we really liked so that we could get more prints made         and give them to family members. So we brought in the CD again to Walgreens and         asked for 18 copies of one of the prints.</p>     <p>         When we came back to pick them up, the photo technician refused to give us the photos.         She claimed that they were "professional" and that we needed to supply proof that         we brought in the original digital image and did not scan the original. A couple         of thoughts come to mind at this point:</p>     <ol>         <li>Thanks for thinking that the pictures were professionally produced. We did it in             our own home with our own camera, so we'll take it as a compliment.</li>         <li>These are our own pictures. <em><strong>I am the artist. I am the proof.</strong></em>             Now give me my fucking prints.</li>     </ol>     <p>         Upon politely asking the technician what they would take as proof, she said that         we would need to bring in the camera so that they could look at the memory card         and see if the original image was on it. I then showed her the 60 prints we had         developed the previous day and said that I deleted the pictures from the memory         card. I asked if the 60 prints were enough proof to show that they were our own         pictures. She skimmed through them and said "Oh, yeah, there's no way you would         have scanned <em>all</em> of these". Evidently that was good enough for her and         she gave us the 2nd set of prints.</p>     <p>         I then told her that we typically delete pictures from our memory card immediately         and just burn the pictures we want to a CD and bring them in that way. I asked if         that wasn't the best way to do it if they always need proof of the original, and         she said that burning and using a CD would be just fine.</p>     <p>         I understand Walgreen's position on this. They're at the front lines trying to prevent         theft of someone's copyrighted work. But the measures that they take to enforce         this policy are very, very week. According to them, either the camera's memory card         or the burned CD would have been enough proof. Someone please explain to me how         they can tell whether a memory card or CD contains a digital image file that has         or has not been scanned from an original. I mean, I could have gone home and put         the image back on the memory card and brought it in. Or I could have scanned the         image, put the new file on the memory card and brought it in. The technician wouldn't         have known either way.     </p>     <p>         Their enforcement measures are weak. On the other hand, what other alternative do         they have? Just like music or any other software, it's difficult to prevent the         spread of file sharing. I suppose that they just want to make their customers jump         through a few hoops to discourage real perpetrators who aren't technical enough         to exploit the loopholes.     </p>     <p>         But perhaps the worst part of the entire event was that we were the artists of the         photos, they didn't believe us, and there really was no evidence in the world that         could provide hard proof that we shot the images.</p>
