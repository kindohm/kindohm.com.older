title: "Quick Movie Report - Thank You for Smoking"
---

<p>Nikki and I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/" target="_blank">Thank You for Smoking</a> last night, and it was excellent.  In fact, it was at four-and-a-half-stars excellent [1].  Let me explain how significant that is:  my Netflix recommendation list is extremely short because I rarely rate movies above three stars.  A move has to really stick out to me to get four stars, and it has to continuously entertain me to get five [2]. The movie is hilarious.  There's no slapstick and the humor isn't dumbed down.  It's funny because of its dialogue and acting, and you can't get much better than that.  I generally dislike slapstick...  But anyway...  if you see the movie, watch for the Hollywood "EGO" scene with Rob Lowe.  I couldn't stop laughing.  The plot is good and the story keeps moving.  It's about a 90 minute movie and doesn't get drawn out.  If you're into cinemetography (not that I'm an expert), they do some cool shots and effects in different scenes which to me makes the movie interesting to watch.  The opening credits were excellent as well.</p>  <p>So, go see it.</p>  <p>[1] I'd give it five stars but I can't easily assess a movie in one viewing.  I'd have to see it again to make sure.</p>  <p>[2] Movies on my "five star list" would include Fight Club, The Matrix, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Those movies' stories are interesting and the production is excellent.  Honestly I'm not sure if I'd put any others on that list (right now).  Office Space is a huge favorite of mine, but there are lulls that make it go slow, so it doesn't get a perfect five stars in my book.</p>
