title: "New Subtext Release"
---

<p>There's a <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2006/06/07/Subtext1.5NautilusRAndREditionReleased.aspx" target="_blank">new release</a> for <a href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> out there.  This is hardly new news, but wanted to post it because <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> is cool.  I'm glad that they've implemented a provider model for the text editor for writing blog entries.  I absolutely hate the FreeRichTextBox control that .Text and Subtext started with.  The new version of Subtext ships with a plain text editor, and I'll be all over that once I upgrade.</p>
