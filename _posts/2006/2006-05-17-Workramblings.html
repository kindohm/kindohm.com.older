title: "Cancelled meetings and phony emails"
---

<p>This week I was planning on taking a full day off to spend time working on our basement, but I changed that plan after I scanned my calendar this weekend and found that I had important meetings or tasks (e.g. deployments) all week. However, all of my important meetings for both yesterday and today have now been cancelled, so I could have taken either yesterday or today off after all. Kinda frustrating.</p> <p>On another note, I'm out at a client right now, and it's amazing to see how many Windows workstations are left unlocked. I can see three unlocked systems from where I'm sitting. Given my company's culture and how eager we are to pounce on a careless office-mate who leaves their workstation unlocked, it's so tempting to do such a thing here at the client site. I'd have no idea what mailing lists or groups are set up here though, so it wouldn't be a very effective prank (to send out a phony email) anyway. I suppose some "intellisense" would kick in as I typed something in the "TO:" field... it's obviously a bad idea anyway and I'd never really do it. Most of my little pranks around the office are pretty harmless though and I write only simple stuff. Just the other day I sent and email from a coworker's computer saying something like "Hey guys, I lost my pony. Please let me know if you find it. Thanks.". A few weeks before I wrote from his computer again: "Everyone - I brushed my teeth this morning. It was pretty fun.". I'm so harmless. I couldn't think of anything mean to write if I tried.</p>
