In about five hours we completed putting up the resilient channel in the soundproof room - which is a major milestone considering its been in an incomplete state for months. It was also the final major task before getting the inspection done. I still need to spend about 30 minutes putting in some fire-blocking for some of the internal framing but that's a small task to be completed later this week.</p>
<p>So now I need to pick up a little bit and call the city to schedule the inspection. Realistically I could get drywall done in November before Thanksgiving. Hmmm, with a little luck I could even get doors, flooring, and painting done by the end of the year. The lazy slacker inside of me is competing with my inner home studio demon that hasn't seen the light of day in over a year. Did that make any sense to you? </p>
