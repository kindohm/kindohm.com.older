title: "Top 10 requested Halo 3 features"

<p><img src="http://lupo91.altervista.org/immagini/halo3/wolverine_01.jpg" width="200" align="right" style="margin: 7px;" /><a href="http://podtacular.com/node/3931" target="_blank">http://podtacular.com/node/3931</a></p> <p>I think this "top 10" list was randomly picked out of somebody's arse, but some of the feature requests are decent:</p> <p><em>More interactive and destructible maps</em> - Absolutely. The gates in Zanzibar are pretty sweet, as an example. I'm no creative genius when it comes to other ideas, but more complex environment manipulation would be really fun.</p> <p><em>Usable Jackal shield</em> - It'd be pretty awesome and would add a new dynamic to the game. It would definitely cater to a defense-first mentality, as you wouldn't have much offensive capability with it (assuming you could only wield a single dual-wieldable weapon while holding a shield). e.g. let your opponent wear themselves out and run out of ammo as they shoot at you, then kill them as they reload or something. </p> <p><em>More playable characters</em> - I posted about something like this in the past, but I had trouble finding it. I'd like to be able to pick the <em>type</em> of Spartan (or Elite) that I want to play like. e.g. fast-running sniper with less armor, slow-moving heavy-weapon specialist with a damage bonus when using rockets, etc. You could piece together a well-rounded team this way.</p> <p>An additional feature I'd like to see is deeper player/character customization. More colors, more variation in appearance (e.g. armor textures?), more logo/emblem options. It'd also be fun to customize things like player size (e.g. tall and skinny vs. short and pudgy) but that'd probably really mess with game balance. </p> <p>Stuff from the article that I don't think would work out:</p> <p><em>A map editor</em> - perhaps, but who wants to play on some lame, unbalanced, unprofessionally-tested map? I can't imagine that most of them would be very good, plus it'd be annoying to get all of your friends to download them (especially if the map is large) before you start playing. </p> <p><em>Bots</em> - at first I thought this would be stupid. Why do you need bots when there is automagic matchmaking? The difference, however is that with bots you could play the type of game that YOU want to play 100% of the time with as many players (as the game allows) as you want. With matchmaking you're at the mercy of the Bungie playlists. I've used Bots in Quake, and they were fun because then you could play by yourself, but it wasn't anything like playing against real people. It's a novelty feature that I don't see Bungie working on.</p>
