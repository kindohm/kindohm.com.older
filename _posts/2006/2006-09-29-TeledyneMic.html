title: "Teledyne Mic"

<p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" src="http://i14.ebayimg.com/02/i/08/6a/fd/d2_2.JPG" align="right" target="_blank" />I just won a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;ih=019&amp;item=290032752892&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3APIC&amp;rd=1" target="_blank">Teledyne EC161</a> off eBay for $25. Man, this is the first thing I've purchased off eBay in about two years. I have no idea if this mic is any good or not, but it's a cheap, small-diaphram condenser which is the type of mic I'm most interested in finding right now. The seller says he uses it for mic'ing a snare, which I'd like to try (someday). For $25 I figured I couldn't go wrong. </p> <p>I've got some other condensers I could experiment with, but I'm a little afraid because they were a bit pricey and I don't want to damage them. And by experiment - I mean expose the mic to a high sound pressure (e.g. close to a snare drum). I'd hate to break the diaphram on a nice, expensive mic. If I break this new one, no biggie.</p>
