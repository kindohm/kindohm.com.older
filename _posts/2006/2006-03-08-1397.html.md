title: "Prepping for NYC"
---

<p>Nikki and I leave tomorrow for New York.  Our hotel supposedly has free wireless broadband internet access, so I'll be posting stuff if there's time.  A picture library feed is available for any pictures we take/upload:  <a href="http://kindohm.com/ngallery/albums/rss.aspx?AlbumID=58" target="_blank">[image rss feed]</a>.  So on Friday when someone asks you "Hey, did you see that picture of Mike base-jumping off the Empire State Building??!!", you can say "Dude, that picture is SO five minutes ago.  I saw it in my aggregator of choice this morning."</p>
