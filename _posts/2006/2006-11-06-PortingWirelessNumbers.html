title: "Porting Wireless Numbers"
---

<p><img src="http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/images/motorola-razr-v3-x-thumb.jpg" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 5px;" />I began the process today of porting our wireless numbers from Cingular to Verizon.  I say "began the process" because it's a longer process than I expected where you have to all a bunch of numbers to initiate the process, confirm the ports, and then call your provider to re-program your phone.  I can understand that all the steps are required but I wasn't expecting to take so much time on the phone with customer care representatives.  The lamest part is that I have to call a 2nd number <strong>after</strong> already calling in the first time to initiate the port so that I can confirm the number change.  Isn't that why I already called the first time?  Why do I have to confirm my decision twice?  Perhaps there's a security/identity issue that I don't yet appreciate.  It should just happen more easily, I think.</p>  <p>One thing I like a lot is Verizon's customer care phone system.  You call and are immediately answered by a representative.  No phone menu and no buttons to push before speaking to someone.  Very nice.  I don't know that I'd recommend Verizon to someone else just because of that, but it's a nice "feature" if customer care is important to you.  </p>
