<p>This one ended up sounding very different from how I envisioned it in the beginning. I didn't envision so much synth and melody stuff happening, but those dimensions just made the tune better (I think). Like the tunes in my last post, I really have no idea how you'd categorize this one. It's electronic, there's samples, there's synths, and there's a hell of a lot of drums happening. </p>
<p>I also created a zip file with all of the samples, the main loops, and the synth lines. It's all wav files, so you can remix and slice and dice things up all you want. Or you can just explore all the wav files and hear things broken down, which is kinda cool too.</p>

<p>I'm still figuring this electronic stuff out.  Hope it sounds ok :)  Enjoy.</p>
