<p>Here's a preview of what I've been working on for the past 1.5-2.0 years:</p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/files/preview.mp3">preview.mp3</a></p> <p>Just a quick compilation of some bits and pieces.  There are 12 instrumentals total that I have lined up, and no lyrics yet.  In fact I'm not planning on doing much else with these tunes until the studio is built.  Plus I'm thinking that I'd like to record vocals directly to the studio computer rather than the digital recorder, so I might as well wait for the new computer too.</p> <p>So in the meantime, nod your head briefly to this stuff :)</p>
