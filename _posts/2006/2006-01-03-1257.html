<P>I'm learning that childrens' DVDs have very, very, very catchy songs on them.&nbsp; Eva received a few DVDs for christmas that we've been playing for her.&nbsp; She's a little young to really be super interested in them, but she watches them a little while she plays on the floor and stuff.&nbsp; She got a Sesame Street All-Star Alphabet DVD [1] and I can't get the &#8220;J&#8221; song out of my head.&nbsp; </P> <P><EM>Jump jump jump jump jumpin' J.&nbsp; Who's going to jump with the jumpin' J?&nbsp; J-J-Jaguar jumps with jumpin' J.</EM></P> <P>[1] Stephen Colbert&nbsp;of Comedy Central's <EM>The Colbert Report</EM> actually stars on the DVD as the letter Z.&nbsp; Weird.</P>
