Basically I'm ripping off a couple of key ideas from some other sites. I've been eager to take advantage of some of the new skinning capabilities in <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> that are available in the newer releases, plus it's just time for a new look and feel. I think I've had my current skin in place for about six months, which is about double the lifetime of my other skins.</p>  <p>I've decided to sell out and put Google ads on my site.  So far I've only put them on one-off technical articles or on my other domains.  I didn't want to clutter up kindohm.com, but on the other hand I really don't know what the revenue potential is.  I get thousands of hits a month, so why not try it?  My goal is to make them as little of a distraction as possible and style them to fit into the site's look and feel.  If it ends up being a bad decision, I can easily take them down.</p>  <p>I need to figure out if I'm going to wait for SubText 2.0 though. Release 1.9 has some nice stuff in it that I'd really like to take advantage of - like Gravatars and comment spam prevention - but 2.0 is just around the corner, and that'll include a plugin framework. Of course I could just upgrade from 1.9 to 2.0 too without much hassle (optimistically).</p> <p>And on a completely different topic: get out and vote today.</p>
