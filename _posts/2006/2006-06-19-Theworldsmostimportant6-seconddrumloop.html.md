title: "The world&#39;s most important 6-second drum loop"

<p>Here's an excellent explanation and analysis of perhaps the most well known drum break on the planet:</p>

<p>It's the Amen break.  If you listened to music in the 80's and 90's you <em><strong>have</strong></em> heard it.  </p>
  
<p>I think the video is excellent.  It is 20 minutes long, and pretty dry, but very interesting.  It covers the history of the original song the break is from, the emergence of samplers in hip hop music, and how the break can be sliced.  Ultimately the video arrives at a discussion about copyrights, the legality of sampling, and an argument of the importance of music and art in the public domain (rather than as locked-up, copyrighted material).  A great explanation, analysis, and opinion.</p>
