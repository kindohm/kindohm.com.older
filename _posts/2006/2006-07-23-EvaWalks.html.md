title: "Eva Walks"
---

<p>Eva has been taking little steps every now and then for a while, but yesterday she really started walking more on her own. She doesn't really get up on her own and start walking, but she'll do it with a little bit of encouragement and if she's already standing up. </p>
<p>So here's are a couple of videos of her walking:</p>
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/videos/eva/evawalks_short.wmv">Eva Walks (5MB)</a>  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/videos/eva/evawalks-short-fantomas.wmv">Eva Walks (with Fantomas accompaniment) (5MB)</a> </li></ul> 
<p>So, what exactly is the reason for the Fantomas accompaniment? I have no idea. I have to keep things interesting and keep you readers on your toes.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I don't use YouTube.com for my videos because as far as I can tell they don't support the 16:9 ratio. I film in nothing but widescreen baby!</p>
