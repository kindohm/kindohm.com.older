<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip" target="_blank">Mobius Strip</a> is a fascinating mathematical phenomenon. </p> <p>Did you know that you can make one out of common everyday objects such as bread crusts?</p> <p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/213980737/"><img height="381" alt="Mobius Crust" src="http://static.flickr.com/86/213980737_519cd84213.jpg" width="500" /></a></p> <p>Yes, it is a Mobius Crust. It's hard to believe it, but it is real. Unfortunately the picture doesn't really do it justice as you can't see all of the curves, but it really is a Mobius Crust.  My next challenge is to create a Mobius RSS Feed.</p>
