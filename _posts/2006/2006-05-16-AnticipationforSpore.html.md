title: "Anticipation for Spore"
---

<p>This game looks absolutely insane.  Will Wright's new game <a href="http://www.spore.com" target="_blank">Spore</a>, will be released sometime in 2007.  Will Wright is the guy behind the Sims and Sim City.  If you have a bit of bandwidth and about 20 minutes of free time, you have to <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/videos/e306/JoystiqE3_Spore.mov">download the E3 demo</a> that Wright performed.  It's about 420 MB but well worth it.  The scale and scope of that game is just crazy.  Personally I've always been a fan of the Sim City games, and Spore is like Sim City on a more minute, grand, and intelligent scale all at the same time.  I'm not sure what the system requirements will be, and I don't know that I'd buy a new system just to play the game, but I'd be really eager to play it.  </p>
  
<p>The "scale of 10's" concept is pretty cool in the game, and the fact that the game allows you to view all the detail in between the simple life form level all the way out to the universe level is amazing.  I don't know what else to say...  there's so much in that demo that is really cool.  </p>
