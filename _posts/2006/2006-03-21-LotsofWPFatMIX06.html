title: "Lots of WPF at MIX &#39;06"

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/03/20/555968.aspx" target="_blank">Tim Sneath just posted an blurb</a> about a <a title="WPF" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/" target="_blank">WPF</a> project he's been working on with a customer.  <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.mix06.com/virtualmix/archive/2006/03/15/iBloks.aspx">This full demo</a> of the project shows off how WPF integrates 2D, 3D, animation, music, and video.  There's a lot of WPF stuff out there that shows off its 3D capabilities, but most of it either isn't very pleasing to the eye (think simple 3D objects on a bright yellow background) or is too simple/abstract to give perspective on how it would be used to solve real problems.  This demo presents what looks like a very pleasing, polished product that gives some perspective on how WPF's 3D and media capabilities could be used.</p>
