title: "Start of the 2006-2007 NHL Season"
---

<p>Tonight is the Minnesota Wild's season and home opener, and the NHL season began last night.  Minnesota hockey fans have a lot to be excited about now that the Wild brass have opened a new chapter in the team's history by acquiring players like Pavol Demitra, Keith Carney, and Mark Parrish.  Demitra is the only real bonafide star among the new faces, but on paper the overall talent level of the team has increased significantly.  </p>
  
<p>I'm planning on blogging after each game I attend this year.  It'll be hard to do because the only way it'll work is to post as soon as I get home, and that's usually pretty late after the game.  Tonight will be the first test and I'll see how it goes.  I want to keep track of how well the Slovakian Gaborik-Demitra chemistry comes along, how fans are enjoying the games, and how the up-and-coming players on the team are getting better.</p>
  
<p>Predictions.  I've always hated predictions.  I tend to prefer observing from a distance and seeing how events cause the final outcome.  I've hated predictions for fear of being wrong.  I've hated predictions because there are so few facts to base them on.  But what's to fear about being wrong?  Nobody is reading this anyway.  After all, it's the NHL.</p>
  
<p><strong>Mike's NHL 2006-2007 Predictions</strong></p>
  
<ul>   
<li>The Wild will finish second in their division behind Calgary.</li>   
<li>The Wild will make the playoffs but won't get past the semis</li>   
<li>Nashville will win the Western Conference title.  It's their time.</li>   
<li>Buffalo will win the East.  Buffalo has built their team well around Drury with Vanek, Miller, and other solid players. </li>   
<li>Buffalo will win the cup.</li>   
<li>This will be Modano's last season.</li>   
<li>The Penguins will finish last in their division again.  Mario, fire your GM, or get out of Pittsburgh.</li>  </ul>
