<div><p>There have been a lot of questions about my <a href="http://hodnick.com/post/616233266/two-audio-masterpieces" target="_blank">two recent audio works</a>. Many of you have wanted to know:</p>  <ol><li>What are the songs about?</li> <li>Are these songs real or just a joke?</li> </ol><p>I was surprised these questions came up at all!  In any case, here are some answers.</p>  <p>The first song is about a fishing trip gone wrong and my encounter with a carp. The second song is very political, which is new for me. Kind of a &#8220;stick it to the man&#8221; song.</p>  <p>These songs are anything but a joke. I mean, how could a song about being attacked by a carp be a joke?!  That carp was HUGE!  It was really going to get me, and get me good. If it weren&#8217;t for all the goalie equipment I was wearing I could have been seriously injured!</p></div>
