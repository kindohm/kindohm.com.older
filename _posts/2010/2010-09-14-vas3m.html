title: "Last Day - 3M Visual Attention Service web site"
---

<div><p>Today marks the final day that my team at 3M is working on the Visual Attention Service web site (<a href="http://vas.3m.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://vas.3m.com" target="_blank">http://vas.3m.com</a></a>).  It has been an awesome year working with this team on a really, really great project.</p>  <p>The list of features and technologies used on this project was impressive:</p>  <ul><li>Public web site built with ASP .NET MVC 2, hosted in Azure</li> <li>Windows Azure (web roles, worker roles, blob storage)</li> <li>SQL Azure</li> <li>Native c++ analysis engine, hosted in Azure</li> <li>Silverlight (file uploads, interactive image preparation)</li> <li>iPhone prototype</li> <li>RESTful web API (xml/json) built with ASP .NET MVC 2, hosted in Azure</li> </ul><p>Briefly, the Visual Attention Service site is used by graphic designers or marketing agencies to quickly determine <em>where</em> people will look within an advertisement or graphic within the <em>first few seconds</em>. Think billboards, magazine ads, menus, brochures, web pages, store displays&#8230; the list goes on. This system is not an eye-tracking system - rather it uses 3M&#8217;s scientific algorithms to determine where a person&#8217;s focus will go first.</p>  <p>Let&#8217;s say I wanted to analyze Apple&#8217;s web site:</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/1121185443_1.jpg" alt=""/></p>  <p>After an analysis the Visual Attention Service tells me where it thinks a viewer will look within the first five seconds by providing a sequence map:</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/1121185443_2.jpg" alt=""/></p>  <p>In the case above, it seems to me that Apple has done a good job of drawing viewers to a single, high-value area at the top of the page with product images and important text. But don&#8217;t take my word for it - I&#8217;m not a vision scientist!</p>  <p>The service also provides a heatmap of the image:</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/1121185443_3.jpg" alt=""/></p>  <p>Contrast these results with the results of today&#8217;s Dell.com web page:</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/1121185443_4.jpg" alt=""/></p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/1121185443_5.jpg" alt=""/></p>  <p>Notice that dell.com&#8217;s first region (the one with the highest percentage) in the sequence is the guy doing flips on a field. The heatmap also seems to show that this region has the highest amount of contrast - it really &#8220;pops&#8221;. Probably not what Dell wants to showcase on their web site.</p>  <p>As I said earlier - I&#8217;m not a vision scientist or an expert in this field. Please don&#8217;t put too much weight on my interpretation of these results. If you sign up for VAS, you can ping the 3M scientists with questions about your analysis and <em>they</em> will give you the real story about your stuff.</p>  <p>As I mentioned before, this team has been awesome. The developers I worked with included <a href="http://twitter.com/weyenbrm" target="_blank">Rick Weyenberg</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/joecasa" target="_blank">Joe White</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/JudahGabriel" target="_blank">Judah Himango</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/scrappydog" target="_blank">Eric Bowen</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/sdigre" target="_blank">Steve Digre</a> did the design work. The team was much more than these five people, but I simply can&#8217;t list everybody.</p>  <p>From the start it has been a results-driven team with a high motivation to continuously produce. We did our first release of the fully-functional web site in two and a half months in November 2009, and since then we&#8217;ve deployed regular enhancements every 2-3 months. This past August we deployed major feature changes including a great Silverlight user interface and the RESTful web API.</p>  <p>This project has certainly been a learning experience. Here are a number of relevant technical blog posts I wrote while working on the project (please note the Azure technology has changed a lot since these posts were written):</p>  <ul><li><a href="http://hodnick.com/post/235271466/azurelessons" target="_blank">Azure Lessons from the Trenches</a></li> <li><a href="http://hodnick.com/post/250969937/azurediagnosticlogging" target="_blank">Azure Diagnostic Logging</a></li> <li><a href="http://hodnick.com/post/407345941/azuretfsdeployments" target="_blank">Automated Azure Deployments with TFS Build</a></li> <li><a href="http://hodnick.com/post/659886406/azuremanagementcertificates" target="_blank">Azure Management API, “Internal Server Error”, and Powershell Azure Commandlets</a></li> <li><a href="http://hodnick.com/post/927338768/httpsazureconfig" target="_blank">HTTPS with Azure, Web APIs, Local Environments, and Build Automation</a></li> </ul><p>Overall this project has been great. I hope I get a chance to work on a team like this again in the future.</p></div>
