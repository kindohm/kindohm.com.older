title: "Halo - Reach Campaign - same old game?"
---

<div><p>Halo: Reach is going to be the first Halo game I&#8217;ll solely buy/play for the Multiplayer content. The Campaign - I&#8217;m not sure I really care. Other gamers made these kinds of claims back in 2007 with Halo 3. Now I&#8217;m jumping on that bandwagon too. Chronologically, Reach will be set earlier in the Halo universe - but it&#8217;s still the same Halo universe. Reach will be a testament to how easy it is to re-use the same successful video game formula over a decade. However, Bungie will continue to blow us away with another first-person shooter multiplayer gaming experience.</p>  <p>About a half year before the game&#8217;s launch, I&#8217;m a Campaign naysayer.</p>  <p>Before I continue, we all know that Reach isn&#8217;t out yet. This is obviously a bunch of predictions.</p>  <p>So about this Halo universe&#8230;  First, in Reach we will be playing as a Spartan so we can expect a familiar HUD, familiar character abilities, and familiar XBox controller layout. Halo ODST, which departed from the Spartan character, <em>still</em> had these familiarities, so I expect Reach to have the same.</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/551179867_1.png" alt=""/><br/><em>Reach Campaign: much different from past Halo editions?</em></p>  <p>Next, we will be fighting against the usual suspects: The Covenant. As past Halo game players, we already know how to fight against Grunts, Jackals, Elites, and Hunters. Pick off Grunts with a pistol head shot. Take down Jackal shields with grenades or some plasma weapons and then clean them up with a rifle. Elites are easily disposed of with either a n00b combo or, my favorite, a Needler. Shoot the Hunters in the back. Do you really enjoy doing all this over and over again over the course of four different Campaigns in four different Halo games?  Some of us probably do. I&#8217;m growing a little weary of this predictable combat.</p>  <p>Then there are the weapons. We can expect a familiar set of old favorites: plasma pistol, needler, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, plasma grenades, frag grenades. You know the drill - certain weapons will be great for taking down shields and others will be good for cleaning up unshielded foes. There are a host of new weapons being introduced into Reach such as a grenade launcher, plasma repeater, and Designated Marksman Rifle. I don&#8217;t see these weapons being a big attraction of the Campaign though - once you find the right weapon combo for each enemy type it&#8217;s the same drill. Weapons alone aren&#8217;t going to make the game.</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/551179867_2.png" alt=""/><br/><em>Focus Rifle: game-changing weapon or same old tactics?</em></p>  <p>There are a few other new nuggets coming in Reach - such as Spartan armor abilities (e.g. armor lock, evade, jet pack, and sprint). These abilities have basically replaced the single-use equipment from Halo 3 (trip mines, bubble shields, etc). These will certainly be fun new shiny things to play with. They may be the one variable that tips the scales and makes Campaign fun again. On the other hand, single-use equipment in Halo 3 didn&#8217;t change the Campaign experience for me. I also don&#8217;t know if these armor abilities can be used in the Campaign.</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/551179867_3.png" alt=""/><br/><em>Armor Lock: will armor abilities make the campaign any more fun?</em></p>  <p>There are other new additions going into the campaign, such as a re-written AI and an open &#8220;sandbox&#8221; experience rather than scripted enemy encounters. For those that truly love game design and the nuances of the gameplay, this will truly be a great reason to check out the Campaign. For me playing on Normal or Heroic difficulty, I don&#8217;t see this being a compelling reason to play Campaign.</p>  <p>Adding up the heroes, enemies, and weapons, can we really expect a Campaign very different from Halo 3? I don&#8217;t think so. In a way I&#8217;m kind of baffled that the same Halo campaign formula has worked for almost a decade over 4 Halo campaigns (5 if you include ODST). More power to Bungie - they&#8217;ve found a great niche.</p>  <p>It&#8217;s no secret I&#8217;m not a hardcore gamer. Maybe that&#8217;s the difference needed to look forward to the campaign. As a spouse and father with about ten hobbies (Halo multiplayer being one of them), I need some pretty compelling reasons to shell out $60 for a game and spend time playing it. Why would I invest time playing the Reach campaign?</p>  <p>All that being said, I can think of a few reasons to play the Reach campaign:</p>  <ol><li><p>The story will actually be compelling. I used to be a huge Bungie and Halo fanboy and loved every fragment of Halo backstory I could get my hands on. In the last three years, that backstory interest has waned and I don&#8217;t seek out the story details like I used to. I&#8217;m skeptical I&#8217;ll enjoy the Reach Campaign for its backstory though - the big questions have been answered :). Perhaps the Reach story will have its own legs to stand on though.</p></li> <li><p>I&#8217;ll need to unlock an achievement in the Campaign to make my multiplayer experience more fun. This is how all of the fancy Spartan and Elite armor in Halo 3 multiplayer worked. Play through the game and then you get to look cool. Halo ODST followed suit - play the Campaign and unlock Firefight characters.</p></li> <li><p>I&#8217;ll have a gamer itch to play a game. Maybe that enhanced AI be really fun.</p></li> </ol><p>Now let&#8217;s talk about Reach multiplayer&#8230;</p>  <p>Halo multiplayer has legs of its own. All Bungie needs to do is add a few new features, new maps, and gamers will play it over and over again. That being said, I expect the new Reach features to make a huge difference. The new armor types and weapons will make for some very fun games. Perhaps the biggest change is the elimination of the Battle Rifle and single-use equipment. There&#8217;s more: fall damage, overheating chain guns, and dormant grenades on the ground that will explode when fired upon. Let&#8217;s not forget there will be some new game types too (Stockpile, Generator Defense&#8230;.).</p>  <p>It looks like Bungie will also introduce the ability to specify the <em>type</em> of multiplayer experience you want when you are matched up with similarly-skilled players online. Skilled, intense games versus laid-back, fun games. You can dial in what type of game you&#8217;re looking for and get matched up with others who are looking for the same.</p>  <p>The Forge editor is also coming back. This feature has so much potential&#8230;  Seeing what map authors did with Forge in Halo 3 I hope Bungie makes Forge for Reach into a legit, high-class editing tool. It&#8217;d be great if Forge for Reach has built-in support for auto-aligning objects and exact placement instead of relying on time-consuming hacks like those required in Halo 3. If we&#8217;re lucky, Bungie will throw in an open, sandbox-style multiplayer map for Forge in Reach when the game ships.</p>  <p>I must admit that Halo multiplayer is a bit &#8220;cartoony&#8221; and unrealistic. Well, of <em>course</em> it&#8217;s unrealistic, being a video game and all! I&#8217;m talking about the fast motion, goofy jumping, and unrealistic nature of combat. However, you can&#8217;t beat this formula for multiplayer and playing with friends. Reach will deliver on multiplayer and will be better than Halo 3 multiplayer.</p>  <p>Now&#8230;  let&#8217;s wait until fall 2010 and see if my mind gets changed!</p>  <p>References:</p>  <ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_Reach" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_Reach</a></li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_</a>(series)</li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.bungie.net/projects/reach/vidaudio.aspx?c=58&amp;i=25729" target="_blank">http://www.bungie.net/projects/reach/vidaudio.aspx?c=58&amp;i=25729</a></li> </ul></div>
