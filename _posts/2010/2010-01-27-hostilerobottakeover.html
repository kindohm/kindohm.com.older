<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>Directly or indirectly, small or large, in some way, shape, or form, this album has been influenced by (in no particular order): me, robots, Keelhaul, Helmet, 311, Melvins, <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~rlindek1/" target="_blank">Dr. Richard Lindeke</a>, <a href="http://leejsackett.com" target="_blank">Lee Sackett</a>, <a href="http://jasonbock.net" target="_blank">Jason Bock</a>, <a href="http://justaddcode.com" target="_blank">Neil Iversen</a>, <a href="http://thoughtstoblog.com" target="_blank">Jake Good</a>, <a href="http://stevedigre.com/" target="_blank">Steve Digre</a>, Nicole Hodnick, Pantera, and Static-X.  Yes, I said Pantera. I&#8217;m not going to bother explaining, but trust me, there are some specific Pantera influences on <em>Escape</em>.</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for Jackie and Greg Gerten, I probably never would have even started this project.</p>
<h3>The Plot</h3>
<p><a href="http://hodnick.com/private/353599738/tumblr_kwu1zmG2gY1qzrz0o" target="_blank">You can view the full lyrics here</a></p>
<p>The lyrics speak for themselves, but here is a more descriptive summary. The story is told in the first person, but I really don&#8217;t picture myself when listening to these songs. Anyway, first I&#8217;m abducted by robots from my home. I&#8217;m taken to some sort of facility where I, along with other human captives, are placed in a crude prison with blue force field walls. Some humans try to overcome the force fields and become injured.  In the meantime, two other robots consider the possibility that the humans might rise up and resist their captivity. We secretly talk to each other and plan a resistance. We find our chance to fight and bring it to the robots. We do considerable damage and use the chance to attempt escape. We fight our way to the doors through a robot defense, but ultimately we fail. Meanwhile, two robots consider the damage done and reveal that they have enslaved the humans.  We concede that we lost our opportunity to escape and that we must now obey and yield to our robot masters.</p>
<h3>Mike&#8217;s Take on All This</h3>
<p>By far this was one of the most enjoyable solo musical projects I&#8217;ve worked on in a long, long time. I think part of it was because four out of the five main tracks have been incubating for some time and I was able to focus just on recording and writing lyrics rather than arranging the music. Tunes like <em>Abducted</em> and <em>Captives</em> have been in the works since about 2002.  Wow that&#8217;s eight years ago. Tunes like <em>Escape</em> started around 2003 and <em>Fight</em> was probably around 2005. <em>Fight</em> actually appears in a different form on the Skill Druids&#8217; &#8220;The Drow&#8221;. <em>Slaves Forever</em> was the only &#8220;new&#8221; song I composed for this collection.</p>
<p>Next, I plan on taking the tracks from this release and slicing them up and remixing them into some ridiculously complex breakcore. Not sure how that is going to go&#8230;</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the music!</p>
