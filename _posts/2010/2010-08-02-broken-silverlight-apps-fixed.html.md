title: "Broken Silverlight apps fixed"
---


<p>Apparently the web hosting company (webhost4life.com) which hosts my ASP.NET / Silverlight applications decided to remove the XAP MIME type from my web site, thus breaking all of my personal Silverlight apps. If you follow my site and have been trying to use an app that appeared to be broken, please try again as I have resolved the issue.</p>




  
<p>In the meantime, don&#8217;t sign up for webhost4life.com.</p>
