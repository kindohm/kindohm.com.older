<p>Inetium (<a href="http://inetium.com" target="_blank">http://inetium.com</a>) is hiring. We have positions waiting to be filled by talented people who have a passion for technology at their core. Our bar is high (at least if I&#8217;m doing the interviewing!), and we require consultants who maintain a high level of care and concern for our customers. We are looking for people who push their own limits of what they know of technology and programming - and bring back what they&#8217;ve learned to reinvest that knowledge back into the company.</p>












  
<p>The best thing about Inetium is that every employee is empowered to create change - on projects, on teams, or in the company.</p>












  
<p>On the forefront of our company&#8217;s technology, we are actively working on and pursuing projects with ASP.NET MVC, Silverlight, Azure (Microsoft&#8217;s cloud computing platform), Android, and SharePoint 2010.</p>












  
<p>We have positions open for:</p>












  
<ul>
<li>.NET developers</li> 
<li>SharePoint developers</li> 
<li>SharePoint IT Pros</li> 
<li>Project Managers and Business Analysts</li> </ul>
<p>If you want to learn more about Inetium and what we do, <a href="http://hodnick.com/ask" target="_blank">contact me</a> and I&#8217;d be glad to answer every one of your questions.</p>
