title: "Inetium Wins Microsoft InfoPath Contest"
---


<p>&#8230;.but it isn&#8217;t just InfoPath. It&#8217;s InfoPath + Silverlight + SharePoint 2010 + CRM. As Microsoft states, it&#8217;s a &#8220;bewildering array of Microsoft technologies&#8221;.</p>












  
<p>Announcement of the contest winner and other entries can be found here: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/infopath/archive/2010/03/08/and-the-winner-is.aspx" target="_blank"><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/infopath/archive/2010/03/08/and-the-winner-is.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/infopath/archive/2010/03/08/and-the-winner-is.aspx</a></a></p>












  
<p>I was fortunate to design and develop the Silverlight user interface for this application - with help from <a href="http://twitter.com/kris_nyreen" target="_blank">Kris Nyreen</a> on the styling, graphics, and colors. The app is very unique - using Silverlight as the front end search and visualization tool. It is an internal Inetium application used to help employees tie together relationships between projects, people, and skills.</p>












  
<p>See for yourself how it works:</p>
