title: "Whispering Prayers in the Cloud"

<p>I've been receiving a little bit of comment spam on my account over on  the <a href="http://tccloud.com">Twin Cities Cloud Computing User Group web site</a>:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">
<p><em>Nice To Meet You, My name is Miss slyvia koneh, As I whisper my prayer tonight and went into search for a nice friend at www.tccloud.com I  came across your contact,My mind and my heart told me to contact you for friendship, A friend who truly understand his or  her friend and share their feelings together. please kindly accept my request, I believe that distance or age can never  be a barrier but let's love connect us because love is a bridge that connected far distance to be close to each other,  I will send my pictures to you immediately i receive your reply at my email address<br/> -----------@------.com<br/> yours In Love,<br/> slyvia<br/> -----------@------.com</em></p>
</p></div>
<p>I'd comment about how foolish the commenter sounds, but that's kind of the whole point.</p>
<p>I just get a kick out of this stuff.</p>
