title: "Windows Phone 7 Dev Tools First Impressions"
---

<div><p>After a couple days of seeing the Windows Phone 7 technology unveiled at MIX10, seeing code-level demos, and getting a chance to tinker with the new WP7 dev tools, I&#8217;m hugely excited and disappointed at the same time.</p>  <p>On one hand, it&#8217;s mobile technology that can finally be developed with .NET and Silverlight-based technology. WP7 apps <em>are</em> Silverlight, for that matter. Windows developers are on the verge of finally being able to deliver great web apps (and by web, I mean everything not on the desktop - mobile, web API&#8217;s, etc) to life. We&#8217;re finally catching up to what the rest of the world is doing.</p>  <p>On the other hand, MIX10 has been nothing but a huge teaser for the technology. The dev tools have been unleashed along with a WP7 emulator:</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/453609901_1.png" alt=""/></p>  <p>That is very cool - but the emulator can&#8217;t do much more than what a plain old Silverlight application can. It shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising, but you can&#8217;t take advantage of features such as the accelerometer, GPS/location API, microphone, or speakers when using the emulator.  For me personally, this means I can&#8217;t really try out <a href="http://silversynth.codeplex.com" target="_blank">SilverSynth</a> on the WP7 yet.</p>  <p>In a nutshell, you can&#8217;t really take advantage of any really cool WP7 features with the emulator. Yes, there is the WP7 navigation flow and the concept of hubs - and we need to work with the emulator and get familiar with those concepts - but the really cool stuff is in the hardware, which we don&#8217;t have.</p>  <p>I also had a couple of opportunities to chat with Charles Petzold today at MIX10. He&#8217;s written the first book on WP7 development and has offered up the first six chapters of the book for free (for now&#160;??) on his web site: <a href="http://charlespetzold.com/phone/index.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://charlespetzold.com/phone/index.html" target="_blank">http://charlespetzold.com/phone/index.html</a></a>. He and I talked about the frustration we have with the limited emulator - and the hope that the content of his book remains relevant when developers are finally able to get their hands on real WP7 devices this fall.</p>  <p>At this point, the WP7 dev tools basically allow early devs to get a taste of what is coming down the pipe - to be ready for the real device later in 2010 and (likely) a revised set of dev tools when the real device arrives.</p>  <p>We developers are never satisfied. I mean, we&#8217;ve been given a <a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com" target="_blank">WP7 developer tool set</a> for free and an opportunity to develop for technology that isn&#8217;t even on retail shelves yet. It&#8217;s hard to complain&#8230;  but yet we always want more.</p>  <p>Happy WP7 coding, and here&#8217;s to an exciting 2010 with more WP7 news to come!</p></div>
