title: "The Jimi Hendrix Experience at McNally Smith"
---

<p>I just got an email from a former college professor (Dave Schmalenberger) of mine about a FREE show he'll be a part of this Wednesday, November 17th at 7:00 PM. He and three others will be performing, in its entirety, Jimi Hendrix's "Are You Experienced" album.</p>
  
<p>Here are the details I got from him:</p>
  
<div style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 30px;"><cite> 
<p> We've been working on a cool project and the concert will be  this wednesday, November 17th, at 7:00 p.m. in the McNally  Smith College auditorium (19 Exchange Street East, St. Paul,  MN 55101).</p>
  
<p>Jerry Kosak (guitar), Charles Fletcher (bass), Steve Faison  (vocals), and myself (drums) will play the entire Hendrix  album "Are You Experienced."</p>
  
<p>Some of these tunes are hard to pull off live, since Hendrix overdubbed several parts.  So, Jerry has been spending lots-o-time creating loops and figuring sounds that help recreate this recording; as well as picking up several pedals and effects to get sounds close to the Hendrix vibe.</p>
  
<p>It's FREE!  It will only last about an hour and 15 minutes max.  And, you'll hear all the tunes on the U.S. release of "Are You Experienced:"</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Purple Haze</li> 
<li>Manic Depression</li> 
<li>Hey Joe (with backup singers!)</li> 
<li>Love or Confusion</li> 
<li>May This Be Love</li> 
<li>I Don't Live Today</li> 
<li>The Wind Cries Mary</li> 
<li>Fire</li> 
<li>Third Stone From the Sun</li> 
<li>Foxey Lady</li> 
<li>Are You Experienced?</li></ul>  
<p>Hope you can join us. BRING EAR PLUGS - it will be loud! <br/>- Dave</p>

<p>I'm not sure I'll be able to make it, but this concert looks awesome.</p>
