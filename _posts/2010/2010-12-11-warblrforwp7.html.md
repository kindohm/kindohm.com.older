title: "Warblr - play tweets as sound on WinPhone 7"
---

<p>Warblr, my first Windows Phone 7 application, was released to the phone marketplace this weekend. Warblr is an audio gadget that plays Twitter tweets as musical sounds. Simply search and play! You control basic aspects of the sound such as speed, scale, octave, and wave form. You can also control more complex aspects of the signal such as frequency and amplitude modulation.</p>
<p>The following screen cast demonstrates all of Warblr's current features:</p>

<p>As the screen cast demonstrates, you can tweet your own custom text from the app to your Twitter account. Your tweet will be appended with a @WarblrApp tag. "@WarblrApp" is the default search phrase in the app - so you can immediately see what other people are sharing.</p>
<p>The purpose of the app is to just have fun. Show it to your friends. They will think you are awesome when you are using this app. Play tweets at parties. Have a Warblr rave. </p>
<p>Warblr is based off of the work I did on "Twitter Synth" for the MIX10k coding challenge in early 2010:  <a href="http://mix10k.visitmix.com/Entry/Details/153">http://mix10k.visitmix.com/Entry/Details/153</a>. Basically it was a fun extension of the digial audio synthesis work I've done with Silverlight.</p>
