title: "SilverSynth - a Silverlight Audio Synth Library"
---

<div><p>Introducing <a href="http://silversynth.codeplex.com" target="_blank">SilverSynth</a>, a digital audio synthesis library for Silverlight. <a href="http://silversynth.codeplex.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://silversynth.codeplex.com" target="_blank">http://silversynth.codeplex.com</a></a>  Straight from the project description:</p>  <p><em>Quite simply, SilverSynth is a Silverlight library used to create awesome sounds in a web browser. It can be used as a core library for developing music-based applications or for just generating noise that annoys your co-workers. It supports synthesis of sine, saw, square and triangle wave forms, frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, panning, volume control, and dynamic envelopes.</em></p>  <p>Much of the core wave form generation code is based off of <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2009/07/Simple-Electronic-Music-Sequencer-for-Silverlight.html" target="_blank">Charles Petzold&#8217;s work</a>.</p>  <p>Silverlight developers can use the library to create a wide spectrum of custom sounds and attach a custom StereoPcmStreamSource to a MediaElement:</p>  <script src="http://gist.github.com/316236.js?file=gistfile1.cs"></script><p>Perhaps the coolest feature of the library is the ability to create signal chains using a fluent API syntax:</p>  <script src="http://gist.github.com/316237.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script><p>The source code also includes a demo app so you can see how the library is used.</p>  <p>Happy noise-making!  Well - before I conclude I should say that aside from noise that annoys your co-workers, you can create some <a href="http://kindohm.com/ksynth" target="_blank">cool</a> <a href="http://kindohm.com/ksynth.b" target="_blank">musical</a> <a href="http://kindohm.com/twittersynth" target="_blank">applications</a> with this stuff too.</p></div>
