title: "Best Halo Reach Beta Footage"
---


<p>I&#8217;ve been eating up all of the Halo: Reach multiplayer beta news and video footage that&#8217;s been popping up lately. I&#8217;ve refrained from posting anything because the gaming sites and Bungie.net pretty much have it covered. But this video is about as good as it gets - 13 minutes of unedited, real-time, narrated Reach gameplay by a Bungie designer. Some great looks at weapons, loadouts, armor abilities, and a the Spartans vs. Elites gametype.</p>
