<div>
<p>Halo 3 is over two years old, but it&#8217;s still a fun game. Fun enough that each Monday night there is a small group of us who get together and play it.</p>
<p>A staple of our Monday evenings has become drag racing:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/i3fZd8lKWdQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/i3fZd8lKWdQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve modified this track and have been playing it for months, but now the excitement is starting to wear off.  I think we all love the insanity the drag race map brings to the table, but we&#8217;re getting a little bored with it.</p>
<p>I decided to create a similar variant that combines the drag racing insanity with Assault/Capture the Flag. Here are some screen shots and descriptions:</p>
<p>Overhead view of the map. Notice the attacker starting point on the left and the defending base on the right:</p>

<p>Attacking team starting point:</p>

<p>A few goodies along the way for the attackers to pick up:</p>

<p>At the end of the strip, the launch point we&#8217;ve all come to know and love:</p>
<p><img src="/hodsmedia/346011852_4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Attackers have an alternate side route. Vehicles can only leave from the base on these routes - not enter:</p>

<p>Defenders have a chain gun available to spray bullets on attackers as they launch:</p>

<p>Better view of the defensive base:</p>

<p>A big, tall back wall is provided to try and keep the lightweight Mongoose ATV&#8217;s from flying out. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s about a 50/50 chance they will stay in bounds!  During play-testing, I found that the ATV&#8217;s just fly super far into the air with the exploding fusion coil plus grav lifts at the launch point. I kind of like the randomness of not knowing if you&#8217;ll make it as an attacker. The bigger Warthogs make it in without risk almost every time.</p>

<p>Secret route to rocket launcher. Approximately equi-distant between offense/defense:</p>
<p><img src="/hodsmedia/346011852_9.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll play this on the coming Monday.  After some play testing with the group - I&#8217;ll try and remember to make this map available for download.</p>
