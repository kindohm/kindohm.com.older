title: "The Home Studio is Officially Complete"
---


<p>This moment has been about eight years in the making.  Eight years ago we moved into a new house with an unfinished basement:</p>

<p>Goal number one was always to &#8220;finish&#8221; this space and create a small music studio. This goal was achieved within the last year or two.  However, a secondary goal was to replace my custom-built studio computer (used for recording and music production) with a much better-performing machine.</p>
<p>The old computer (watch the video to hear how unbearably loud it ran - not good for a studio):</p>

<p>The old computer was a Pentium 3 running at 733 Mhz with about 700&#160;MB (or so) of RAM. When I built it, I also purchased Cakewalk&#8217;s Sonar (version 1) recording software. Back then in the year 2000 (or so), I could record one stereo track of drums, a few guitar tracks, a bass track, and a few vocal tracks and mix them down with a few effects running and the computer could get by.</p>
<p>Eventually I started doing dynamics processing on each track (EQ and compression) and wanted to record more tracks for my drums.  The old computer just became obsolete. I eventually purchased a Yamaha AW16G hard disk recorder:</p>
<p><img src="/hodsmedia/327922527_1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This recorder allowed me to perform dedicated dynamics processing on each track and also allowed me to record up to eight simultaneous tracks of drums.  This little machine is extremely useful, but by today&#8217;s digital audio workstation standards on a computer it has a clumsy user interface (it basically lacks a keyboard, mouse, and display).</p>
<p>Thus, I always wanted to get a replacement studio computer that would have enough horsepower to perform a good amount of effects processing on a large number of tracks.  I&#8217;ll still utilize the AW16G for recording in some circumstances, but not for mixing or final production.</p>
<p>Now the new studio is complete with a new Dell (under the table on the left):</p>

<p>The new Dell has plenty of horsepower with a Pentium Core 2 Duo Quad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still running the first version of Sonar, believe it or not. It&#8217;s almost a 10-year old product. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll actually use some non-ancient software!</p>
<p>Anyway - this new Dell purchase pretty much finishes up the original studio plans.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll crank out my next project soon and you can hear the results!</p>
