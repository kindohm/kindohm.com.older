<div><p>Need a fun diversion? Try out Silverlight Sampler:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/SilverlightSampler" target="_blank">http://www.kindohm.com/SilverlightSampler</a></p>  <p>13 wave file samples, delay and filter effects, one big loop.</p>  <p>I wrote the app from scratch using Silverlight and C#. Samples are from <a href="http://ihatebreakcore.com" target="_blank">http://ihatebreakcore.com</a>. Delay and filter effects are from <a href="http://musicdsp.org" target="_blank">http://musicdsp.org</a>.</p>  <p>The app is rough and buggy but I wanted to get the app out into the wild for people to try out. There are some specific bugs with the delay and filter effects with high amplitude samples (e.g. the snare).</p>  <p>You can also download a sample song I created with the app: <a href="http://kindohm.com/SilverlightSampler/SilverlightSamplerDemo.mp3" target="_blank">SilverlightSamplerDemo.mp3</a></p>  <p>Enjoy!</p></div>
