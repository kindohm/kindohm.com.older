title: "Blogging with Jekyll Anywhere"
---

 <p>Yesterday I got Cygwin set up with Ruby, RubyGems, and Jekyll so that I could get my Jekyll blogging process to run on more than just my Ubuntu VM. I'm now able to write posts from my Windows machine as well, which is  crucial for Windows-related posts when I'm using screen shots and code snippets. </p>  <p>I also set up some basic rsync scripts to deploy my site. A lot of Jekyll bloggers out there are relying on  git post-commit hooks to do some nice stuff with their git repositories to publish their sites, but that setup just doesn't work for me and my specific web site strategy.</p>  <p>My next task will be to get Jekyll running on my Rackspace Ubuntu machine out in the cloud so that I could <em>literally</em> post from anywhere by ssh'ing in to my box.</p>  <p>This post is a final test on my Windows machine to make sure it all works as expected.</p>
