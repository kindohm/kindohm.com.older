<p>Thanks to everyone who attended my session at Iowa Code Camp yesterday about Silverlight out-of-browser features, network detection, web cam integration and microphone integration. All of the code I presented is available on github: <a href="http://github.com/kindohm/silverlight-app-does-what">github.com/kindohm/silverlight-app-does-what</a>.</p>
  
<pre><code>git://github.com/kindohm/silverlight-app-does-what.git</code></pre>
<p>For the non-github inclined, you can also download a zip archive:</p>

<p>The event was a blast - much thanks to the event organizers for putting on a great code camp!</p>
  
<p>And, thanks to the brave volunteer to came up front for the "what our children might look like" demo:</p>
