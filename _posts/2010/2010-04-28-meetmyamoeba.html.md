<p><em>Meet My Amoeba</em></p>










  
<p>A beautifully obnoxious tune by yours truly. Sit back, hang on and enjoy. You can download the mp3 directly too: <a href="http://hodsaudio.net/mp3/Electronica/Parser.MeetMyAmoeba.mp3" target="_blank">Parser.MeetMyAmoeba.mp3</a> (7.5&#160;MB)</p>










  
<p>If you&#8217;re like me and have a kid around the house, mind the language on this track.</p>










  
<p>UPDATE: I jumped the gun a little bit on releasing this. While the form won&#8217;t change, there are some qualities of the sound that just aren&#8217;t right yet. Stay tuned for an update.</p>










  
<p>UPDATE 5/5/2010: Final mix posted. Tweaked slightly. Enjoy.</p>
