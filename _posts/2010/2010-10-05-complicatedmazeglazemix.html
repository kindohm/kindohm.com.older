title: "New Music - Complicated Maze (Glaze Mix)"
---

<div><p>I just completed a remix of an older tune I recorded back around 2005. I used the original vocal track and added in a lot of new flavor.</p>  <p>You can listen to and download the track from Bandcamp:</p>  <p><a href="http://parser.bandcamp.com/track/complicated-maze-glaze-mix" target="_blank">Complicated Maze (Glaze Mix)</a></p>  <p>You can also listen to the original version:</p>  <p><a href="http://kindohm.bandcamp.com/track/complicated-maze" target="_blank">Complicated Maze - original ROCK AND ROLL!!! version</a></p>  <p>The singing isn&#8217;t the greatest, but bearable!</p>  <p>Enjoy.</p></div>
