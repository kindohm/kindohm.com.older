title: "Halo - Reach release is tomorrow"
---


<p>The long-awaited Halo: Reach game for XBox 360 launches tomorrow. Is anybody not excited? I have my copy reserved and I plan on playing for a long time after little kiddie bed time Tuesday night. My daughter is pretty excited about the game too, believe it or not. She and I use Forge in Halo 3 all the time.</p>












  
<p>At the bare minimum, the new Halo will be a new set of multiplayer maps. That alone would keep me coming back to Halo. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the new armor abilities, game variants, customizable armor, and of course the new Forge tools and Forge World.</p>












  
<p>For the first time in the Halo series I&#8217;m not so interested in the Campaign. I know I will enjoy playing it, but at this moment I don&#8217;t plan on cracking open the Campaign until my multiplayer itch is scratched. Let your imagination run wild with that last sentence.</p>












  
<p>Bungie put out this video today of multiplayer footage on the Cage map along with voice commentary from a few Bungie employees. They exploit the map&#8217;s height with the jetpack and talk a little bit about Forge.</p>

<p>Really, really, really looking forward to this&#8230;</p>
