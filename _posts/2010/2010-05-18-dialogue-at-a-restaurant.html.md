<ul>                
<li>                     <strong>Server:</strong>                     Would you like chips, fries, or fruit with your sandwich?                 </li>                                 
<li>                     <strong>Me:</strong>                     Is the fruit a &quot;Fruit Cup&quot; or a &quot;Fruit Boat&quot;?                 </li>                                 
<li>                     <strong>Server:</strong>                     It&#039;s a Fruit Boat.                 </li>                                 
<li>                     <strong>Me:</strong>                     Is it seaworthy?                 </li>                                 
<li>                     <strong>Server:</strong>                     Yes, it&#039;s very good.                 </li>                                 
<li>                     <strong>Me:</strong>                     I&#039;ll have the Fruit Boat.                 </li>                                 
<li>                     <strong></strong>                     ...it wasn&#039;t seaworthy. It would have sunk like the Titanic.                </li>                 </ul>
