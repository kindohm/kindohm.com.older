title: "Digital Audio Synthesis on Windows Phone 7"
---


<p>Back in March 2010, I <a href="http://hodnick.com/post/453609901/wp7devtoolsimpressions" target="_blank">posted about my initial excitement and disappointment</a> with the Windows Phone 7 developer tools. Back then, then WP7 emulator didn&#8217;t support the MediaElement&#8217;s SetSource method. SetSource provides the basis for being able to do digital audio synthesis with custom MediaStreamSource objects.</p>














  
<p>With the new WP7 beta tools, I&#8217;m happy to say that the SetSource method is now supported by the WP7 emulator - so you can now hear and play your synthesized audio!</p>














  
<p>I created a very simple audio synthesis app to demonstrate these features:</p>

<p>The app lets you pick from two audio sources: one source generates random noise and the other source generates a constant, smooth set of tones.</p>














  
<p>Happy WP7 coding!</p>
