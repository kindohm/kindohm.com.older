                  <div class="quote">&ldquo;Once you hear it in your head, it&#8217;s like being a carpenter - trying to build the thing when you already know what it is.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <p>&#8230;<a href="http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_rick_rubin/" target="_blank">quoted from Rick Rubin</a>.</p>  <p>My friend and colleague <a href="http://justaddcode.com" target="_blank">Neil</a> suggested that software production is more analogous to movie production than the popular analogy of &#8220;building a house&#8221;. This new analogy came up again today in a conversation I had with <a href="http://twitter.com/eraarup" target="_blank">eraarup</a> - not with respect to movies but with respect to music production. I came across this quote by Rick Rubin and it is very fitting. I think Rubin&#8217;s idea of producing music is very similar to producing a custom technical product such as a web site. Someone has the vision and gets everyone to build it.</p></div>
