<p>Lyrics:</p>
<p><em>If you're really into software development<br/> Twin Cities Code Camp!<br/> and you're near the Minneapolis/St. Paul area<br/> Twin Cities Code Camp!<br/> <br/> You live and breathe code every day or you'll die<br/> You write unit tests just to save your life<br/> Windows or Mac you just don't care<br/> <br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> <br/> Wanna learn somethin' new, don't wanna get complacent<br/> Twin Cities Code Camp!<br/> Your apps are nothing short of magnificent<br/> Twin Cities Code Camp!<br/> <br/> You live and breathe code every day or you'll die<br/> You write unit tests just to save your life<br/> Windows or Mac you just don't care<br/> <br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> You want code? YEAH!<br/> <br/> Twin Cities Code Camp!<br/> </em></p>
<p>The song was written by yours truly. I recorded drums, bass, guitars, and vocals, and  <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net">Jason Bock</a> shredded out the lead guitars. Last but not least the Twin Cities Code Camp Chorus (a.k.a. the attendees from the event on 4/9/2011) provided some epic group shouting! Thanks to everybody who participated!</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! We also have a music video... in high definition even!</p>

<p>Wow! Epic! Not even a pack of llamas can beat that!</p>
<p>In addition to the music video, a whole set of interviews are also available from April 9th and 10th, 2001 on our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TwinCitiesCodeCamp">Twin Cities Code Camp YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who attended that weekend! See you this fall at TCCC #11!</p>
