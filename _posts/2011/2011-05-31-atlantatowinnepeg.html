title: "NHL Atlanta Thrashers Move To Winnipeg"

<p>It looks like the deal is final. The NHL's Atlanta Thrashers will move to Winnipeg:  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/blogs/122860588.html">http://www.startribune.com/sports/blogs/122860588.html</a></p>

<p>I was disappointed when the Jets left Winnipeg back in 1996 and now I'm glad a team will be coming back. I assume the Thrashers will be re-named back to the Jets after they move. I imagine the Jets would be in the Western conference with the Wild after a  league re-alignment takes place in a few years, which would be cool. The league re-alignment in general is a big deal and the addition of a Winnipeg team will really change things up. Looks like the Wild may end up moving from the Northwest to the Central division and play with teams like Chicago, Detroit, Columbus, and St. Louis.</p>
