title: "Basic cursor control with Kinect hand tracking in WPF"

<p>I just produced another Kinect/WPF post on my Avtex blog. This one shows how I used the NITE library to track my hand movements  and use my hand to control the mouse pointer in a WPF app.</p>

<p>Part of the effort of developing a new application for our new front display in the Avtex lobby is nailing down how users will control a "mouse pointer"  on the screen with their hand in mid-air. To keep things simple, we basically want to show and move a hand-shaped cursor on the screen as the user  moves their hand - similar to what you see in XBox 360 Kinect games like Adventures and Sports.</p>

<p>Here's a very quick screen cast of the example app I built:</p>
