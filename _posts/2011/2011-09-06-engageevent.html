<p>On September 14th at 4:00 PM, Avtex will be co-hosting an event called <a href="http://engageevent.net/">Engage</a>. It will be held at the Microsoft Technology Center  in Minneapolis and will feature a variety of unique applications that my team and I at Avtex have developed - six of which leverage the Kinect sensor.</p>
