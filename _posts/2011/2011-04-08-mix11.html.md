title: "MIX11 Conference Next Week"

<p><img src="https://msteched.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/BlogPost/news/MIX11_BB_SeeYouAt_1.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" alt="MIX11" /> I'll be flying out to Las Vegas next week to attend Microsoft's MIX11 conference. This conference primarily focuses on user experience design and development for the web and also for Microsoft technologies such as WPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone 7, and Windows tablets/slates.</p>
<p>I'll be interviewed at the conference (they will be recorded, not streamed) by Microsoft about some of the work we're doing at <a href="http://www.avtex.com">Avtex</a> on our innovation team with Windows Phone 7, the Kinect device, and Windows slates. In  support of these interviews we'll be publishing a couple of  Avtex blog posts about what we've been doing with the Kinect device. Specifically, we're writing about the content browsing app we've developed for use in our front lobby and at trade shows. I'll reference these posts and the recorded interview when they become available.</p>
<p>I'm very excited to see what comes out at MIX this year. I predict something big is going to be announced about Silverlight 5 - something that Microsoft hasn't already announced about it.  Another prediction of mine is that Microsoft will release their Kinect SDK. This is what I'm most excited about, but it's only a prediction. I'll be bringing along my Kinect device to the  conference... and if I can stay awake late enough after all of the late-night events I'm hoping to do some coding right away with any newly-baked bits.</p>
