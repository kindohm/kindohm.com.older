<p> <img src="/hodsmedia/avtex.png" alt="avtex" style="float: right;width:300px;margin-left:5px;border: solid 1px #cccccc;" />  As of January 1st, 2011 Inetium has merged with Avtex and we are now known as  <a href="http://www.avtex.com" target="_blank">Avtex</a>.  We've been in the process of merging since the fall of 2010. The new Avtex will keep the core skills and services that Inetium has always brought to the table: expertise in .NET programming, Microsoft platforms such as SharePoint and CRM, creative design, and networking/infrastructure.</p>
<p>Just prior to our merger, Inetium acquired Convergent Solutions - a nationally recognized company that focused on VoIP and communication solutions using .NET and Lync. The "classic" Avtex focused on building innovative contact center solutions.</p>
<p>The new Avtex results in a synergistic new company that has deep experience in core Microsoft .NET technologies and products along with innovative VoIP and contact center solutions. This means we will engage in all of the classic solutions and projects that the original companies always have in addition to taking on new projects that combine our skills and expertise across the company.</p>
<p>Inetium had about 100 employees. The new Avtex will have a little more than 200.</p>
<p>In addition to our classic services,  Avtex has expaneded a dedicated innovation team that is tasked with  developing our own IP and products, doing research and development on new technology, and educating our customers and company on emerging technologies, patterns, and  practices. Most recently we've been building prototype applications on Windows Phone 7 devices. I'm fortunte to be a member of this team.</p>
<p>Inetium was always a unique company where we owned the customer's problem and solution. At Avtex we will continue to do that, but with a much broader set of skills and experience.</p>
<p>2011 is going to be an exciting year for Avtex and it will be fun to see where we go!</p>
