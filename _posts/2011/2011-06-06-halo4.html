title: "Halo 4 and Halo CE Remake"
---

<p>I was certain that there would not be any more Halo video games after Halo: Reach. I was wrong. At the E3 convention today it was announced that Halo 4 is planned for release at the end of 2012.</p>

<p>The scree grab above was taken from this video:  <a href="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/33823" target="_blank">Halo 4 Trailer Official E3 2011</a></p>
<p>The one caveat is that Bungie is not developing Halo 4. 343 Industries will be the developer behind the Halo 4 title. My gut tells me that the game will look and feel subtly different since it won't be coming from Bungie... for better or for worse.</p>
<p>l
<p>The game appears to pick up where Halo 3 left off: the Master Chief (in cryosleep) is in a half-destroyed space craft with Cortana, his companion AI, as they are approaching an unfamiliar world, species, or technology.</p>
<p>But that's not all that is news in the Halo universe...</p>
<h3>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition</h3>
<p>A complete re-make of the original Halo: Combat Evolved title will be released Fall 2011! The original Halo game is ten years old, and this anniversary edition will hopefully be polished with new graphics and improved gameplay. The anniversary edition will also ship with remakes of seven of the original Halo: CE multiplayer maps, as well as online co-op campaign.</p>
<p>It's not clear to me who is developing the Halo: CE remake.</p>
<p>The Halo: CE remake might not be much more than a money-making opportunity to take advantage of us nostalgic Halo fanboys, but so be it. I'm totally going to buy it.</p>
<p>I'm most excited about Halo 4 - there are so many unanswered questions from Halo 3 that might get answered. For that matter, there will be many more questions raised after playing Halo 4!</p>

<p>Also at E3 - an XBox 360 and Kinect version of Minecraft. Really? That sounds exhausting just thinking about it!</p>
