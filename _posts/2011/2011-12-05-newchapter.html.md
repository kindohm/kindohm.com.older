title: "A New Career Chapter"

<p><img src="/hodsmedia/crossroads.jpg" alt="crossroads" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/> Almost exactly seven years ago, I joined Inetium (now known as Avtex) as a .NET consultant. In that seven years I've been able to work on some outstanding projects and also work with technologies that emerged over that time. I've done work on Kinect motion-based apps, Silverlight out-of-browser tablet apps, Windows Phone 7 apps,  ASP.NET MVC web sites hosted in Windows Azure, and a large variety of (gasp!)  SharePoint projects.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I've met so many great people in that seven years who I have been able to work with as co-workers. Never have I enjoyed working side by side  with other people as I have at Inetium and Avtex. </p>
<p>My time at Avtex has come to an end. My last day at Avtex was 12/2/2011. I am very happy to now begin a new career as an independent consultant!</p>
<p>My ambition to work independently began years ago. The consulting and programming stars have all aligned and I decided that right now was the right time to take the leap and go into business for myself.</p>
<p>I can't thank enough my peers and friends who helped me research and make this decision to go independent. The process of making the decision took much more thought than I expected.  I've learned so much from other consultants about finances, networking, and running a  business over the past few months. For those of you who helped, thank you so much!</p>
<p>I look forward to what 2012 will bring. I'm sure there will be some bumps along the way as I learn the ropes of being independent, but at the same time I hope it will be  satisfying and rewarding.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of 2011, and I'll see you for more exciting times in 2012!</p>
