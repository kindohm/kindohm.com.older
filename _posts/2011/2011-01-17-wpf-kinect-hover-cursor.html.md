title: "Creating a Kinect selection progress cursor in WPF"
---

<p>Late last week I wrote this post on my Avtex blog on how to create a "hover selection cursor" for a Kinect-based app in WPF. This type of cursor is very similar to what you see in Kinect games on the XBox 360 where you hover your hand over a command and see a progress indicator to let you know how long you need to hover your hand for the command to execute:</p>

<p>At Avtex we are working on a Kinect-enabled WPF application for our lobby&#39;s 60&quot; front display. The application will allow guests to have an interactive experience with our company at the point of their entry.</p>
<p>The Kinect allows us to control the mouse pointer through hand tracking. If you&#39;ve played any of the XBox 360 Kinect games you&#39;ve probably noticed some new user interface metaphors with how to select and execute commands.  Specifically, you&#39;ve probably seen the most basic gesture of hovering your hand (e.g. the cursor) over a command in order to execute it:</p>

<p>The link above includes the source code.</p>
<p>I also created a quick screencast to demonstrate the feature:</p>


<object width="560" height="340">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pEFYkb8rGaY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param>
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param>
<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>

<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> I apologize for the code not being readable in the screencast. It wasn't my intention for viewers to use the screencast as a code reference, but a few people have pointed out that the code is hard to read in the video. If you want the complete code details, you can download the source code from the  <a href="http://blogs.avtex.com/blogs/mhodnick/archive/2011/01/14/creating-a-kinect-selection-progress-cursor-in-wpf.aspx">original Avtex blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
