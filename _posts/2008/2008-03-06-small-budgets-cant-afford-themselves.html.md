title: "Small budgets can&#39;t afford themselves"
---

<p>I've been on a new project for three days.  The development budget is pretty small - about 240 hours.  For these three days I've been doing nothing but estimating and helping plan for new scope.  10% of the budget has now been used up on estimating and planning features that can't be paid for.  Small projects can kill, I tell you.  </p>
