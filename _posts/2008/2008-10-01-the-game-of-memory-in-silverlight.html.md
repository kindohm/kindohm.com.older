title: "The Game of Memory in Silverlight"
---

<p>At home, we got Eva the game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Original-Memory/dp/B00000IWDD/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;qid=1222869172&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Memory</a> - which she really seems to enjoy playing.  Eva has also been very curious about the computers we have around the house, and she's also played a few very simple kids computer games.  </p>
  
<p>As a small challenge, I thought it'd be fun to write the game of Memory for Eva to play on the computer in a Silverlight or WPF application.  </p>
  
<p>I've made little bits of progress over the last week, and now have something to show for it:</p>

<p>After some more polish, I'll post the code and a playable version soon. </p>
