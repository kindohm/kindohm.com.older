title: "The World Without Us"
---

<p>This weekend I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Without-Us-Alan-Weisman/dp/0312347294/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1210595691&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>The World Without Us</em></a> by Alan Weisman.  It's a book that explores what would happen on Earth if humans suddenly disappeared.  </p>  <p>When I started reading the book, I thought it was going to be a fun exploration of what would happen to our houses, driveways, buildings, cities, and other man-made things.  It certainly is all of those things.  But the book covered a lot more that I didn't expect: What would happen to all of the oil processing facilities on the gulf coast if they suddenly became un-manned?  What about nuclear power plants when nobody is there to watch over them?  What would happen if humans stopped farming and mass agriculture?  The book even talks about the impact of war on our planet (and it's not necessarily an environmental impact).  </p>  <p>I liked the author's style as he didn't use the book as a personal soapbox about how humans should "go green".  Instead, he just presents facts, makes references to data, and lets the reader draw their own conclusions.  You can't write a book like this without putting the impact of humans on Earth in a negative context, but Weisman doesn't go out of his way to make those claims, and if anything I think he tries to stay away from it.  That being said, I believe that anybody who reads this book will at minimum become more aware of the impact they have on this planet.  You may even change something in your life if you read this book.</p>  <p>Ultimately the book raises serious questions about preserving our lifestyle and our species on Earth.  It points out the things we are doing today that will prevent us from maximizing our stay on the planet.  At one point I concluded that the only way we can sustain life on this planet as humans is to eliminate every comfort and modern amenity we take for granted today (electricity, mass food production, etc).  Possibly go back to self-sufficiency and communities that truly depend on its people to help each other <em>live</em>.</p>  <p>The book ends by arguing that if humans are truly an example of intelligent life then that intelligence needs to be put to the test by confronting worldwide population control.  I don't have the data in front of me, but I believe the book states that within this century the world's population will double if we maintain current birth rates.  The author suggests that, starting today, limiting females to producing only one child in their lifetimes that the population would reduce to 19th century levels by the end of the current century.  By halving the population, imagine the reduced impact on the Earth and the smaller demand on resources.  No human would be sacrificed in the process.  The loss of offspring through attrition would be reduced by focusing more intensely on preserving the latest generations because of their smaller numbers.  The question is, can humans come to terms with this?  Would people reel at being stripped of the freedom to produce as many children as they please?  I don't think our planet cares.</p>  <p>I don't really consider myself to be "green".  To me, the focus on being "green" has always had the connotation of keeping the Earth clean for Earth's sake.  That may or may not be true.  But what is more real and more tangible to me is reducing our impact on this planet for our own sake.  Call it "green" or whatever you want.  If humans want to stick around on Earth longer, or until the Sun swallows us, we'll need to carry out our lives differently.</p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:553cdd08-80b1-4b48-b9bb-cda76c5960bf">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/world%20without%20us" target="_blank" rel="tag">world without us</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/book" target="_blank" rel="tag">book</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/earth" target="_blank" rel="tag">earth</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/environment" target="_blank" rel="tag">environment</a></div>
