title: "Lots of Basement Progress"
---

<p>We may be on our way to finishing our basement project within a few weeks.  There are really only three core construction tasks left:</p> <ol> <li>Painting</li> <li>Install doors (4)</li> <li>Install trim/millwork</li></ol> <p>Nikki and I are aiming to be done with #1 and #2 by the end of this weekend.  The studio is already painted.  The rest of the basement is about 80% primed, and we'll finish that work tonight.  For the rest of the week we'll be putting on the final coats at night.  For the doors, I'll be getting a family member (who is relatively skilled at door installation) to help out - hopefully on Sunday.</p> <p>With some luck we'll finish the trim and millwork the following weekend.  After that, there is a large laundry list of minor tasks to complete.  Among the more important ones are:</p> <ol> <li>Install light fixtures</li> <li>Wire up CAT-V outlets and finish networking</li> <li>Put a door on the circuit breaker box enclosure</li></ol> <p>Some of the minor tasks that can be done at any time include finishing touches on sound-proofing in the studio, buying a toilet seat for the toilet, re-organizing our storage situation to leverage the new space, buying furniture, decorating, and of course the procurement of new entertainment equipment.  </p> <p>It's kind of weird to look at the basement as it was before we started construction:</p> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/385021963/" title="Bare basement before the project #3 by kindohm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/131/385021963_4dccc1aa42.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Bare basement before the project #3" /></a></p>  <p>...and to compare it to what it looks like now (this photo was actually taken last summer):</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/1181342191/" title="P8200066 by kindohm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1401/1181342191_785a4bd74b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="P8200066" /></a></p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:1a6c9fa2-3bac-422c-bf0d-177f636d6aa3">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/basement" rel="tag" target="_blank">basement</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/project" rel="tag" target="_blank">project</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/home" rel="tag" target="_blank">home</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/remodeling" rel="tag" target="_blank">remodeling</a></div>
