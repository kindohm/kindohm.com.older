title: "Guitar Hero 3 on Medium - Done"
---

<p>I completed Guitar Hero 3 on the Medium difficulty last night.  In all honesty, it didn't take too much effort to do, but the last set of songs were getting to be tough.  I was able to play through each song on the first try, but didn't get 100% on any of them.  I consistently hung around the 95-98% range, but the Slayer song is going to be the thorn in my side on the Hard setting...  on Medium I only got 67% on that one.  </p> <p>I was concerned before picking up the game that it would be too easy.  Considering that about a quarter of the songs on Medium really got fun and were challenging to play through, I'm not concerned any more.  I'm going to tackle the Hard difficulty next...  I know I can play through the easier songs on Hard but I'm sure I'll need to really dig in and fail a few times on the harder songs.  I'm looking forward to tackling the Priestess, Muse, and Disturbed tunes... even though they aren't the most difficult.  </p>   <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ff3a93ce-2246-4016-aa6e-da692d4ab083">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/guitar%20hero" rel="tag" target="_blank">guitar hero</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/video%20games" rel="tag" target="_blank">video games</a></div>
