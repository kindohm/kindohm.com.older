title: "VS Developer Types - now more user-friendly"

<p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/VSDevelopers" target="_blank">VS Developer Types</a> has been enhanced so that you no longer need to complete the survey in order to see the results.  I wanted to hide the results at first as an incentive to complete the survey and a way to capture as much data as possible, but there were enough complaints about this that I reversed my evil ways.  If anything, I hope I can capture more data by opening up the results because folks might be more inclined to visit the site.  </p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:466f1a13-887d-4aac-a752-e02eb18fa4b2">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/programming" rel="tag" target="_blank">programming</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/visual%20studio" rel="tag" target="_blank">visual studio</a></div>
