title: "The Decentralization of Mike Hodnick"
---

<p>I'm moving things.  Visit <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/kindohm.aspx">the new kindohm.com</a>.  </p> <p>You can follow my antics on Tumblr:</p>  <p><a href="http://kindohm.tumblr.com/">http://kindohm.tumblr.com/</a></p>  <p><a title="http://kindohm.tumblr.com/rss" href="http://kindohm.tumblr.com/rss">http://kindohm.tumblr.com/rss</a></p>  <p>I'm not 100% sure I'm doing things in exactly the best way, but I'm throwing something out there and seeing if it sticks.  </p>  <p>The best way I can say it is that I want to get away from a big, centralized web app/blog.  The "blog" is the main face of kindohm.com and the focal point of "Mike Hodnick", and it isn't going to be those things any more.  The blog hosted here may still be a tool of some use, but it won't be the focus.  When I set this blog up four years ago, there wasn't another app out on the web (hosted by someone else) that was a good alternative.  Today, four years later, there are so many great services out there for free that offer fantastic features.  I'm heading in that direction.  I'm spreading myself out.  </p>  <p>The new kindohm.com has a new face.  If you're reading this in an RSS aggregator, then you're not seeing it.  But the new home page offers a unified starting point for all things Mike:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com">http://www.kindohm.com</a></p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:a5ccfe52-4b0b-44de-a726-1b9f5268f106">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/blog" rel="tag">blog</a></div>
