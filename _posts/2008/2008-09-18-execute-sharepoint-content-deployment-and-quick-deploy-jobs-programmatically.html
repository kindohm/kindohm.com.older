title: "Execute SharePoint Content Deployment (and Quick Deploy) Jobs Programmatically"
---

<p>This is arguably one of the easiest tasks you can perform in code as a SharePoint developer, but not very well known or documented.  Start off by referencing the Microsoft.SharePoint.Publishing assembly.  The rest is cake:</p>  <pre><code>// assume we're using the
// Microsoft.SharePoint.Publishing.Administration namespace

ContentDeploymentJobCollection jobs = ContentDeploymentJob.GetAllJobs();

foreach (Job job in jobs)
{
  Console.WriteLine(job.Name);
  job.Run();
}
</code></pre>
 <p>The ContentDeploymentJob class also has a GetAllQuickDeployJobs() method to return only Quick Deploy jobs.</p>  <p>The ContentDeploymentJob class hosts the expected methods and properties you'd find on a job, such as Name, Description, LastStatus, Run(), and Test() (among others).</p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:d2cd128c-b1d5-436f-ad98-9736a0aa67ac">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/sharepoint" rel="tag">sharepoint</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/code" rel="tag">code</a></div>
