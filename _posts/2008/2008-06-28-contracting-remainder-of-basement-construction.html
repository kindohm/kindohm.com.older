title: "Contracting Remainder of Basement Construction"
---

<p>The white flag was waved.  A contractor was called.  An estimate was done.  The work will be scheduled.</p>  <p>We've put up with the delay of finishing our basement long enough.  There are countless things we'd rather do than work on it.  We're also in the phase where there is a lot of detail and finishing work to do, and that's definitely not my specialty.  </p>  <p>Tentatively, the contractor will be finishing the remaining work over a weekend in July.  That includes all of the trim work (including painting), building the threshold and cutting the door for the studio, window trim/ledge detail, and a custom door/cover for the electrical panel.</p>  <p>It will be a huge relief when all of this is done - and taken care of by a professional.</p>  <p>Still, there will be a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of work (not necessarily labor) to be done after the construction is finished.  We still have light fixtures to find/buy/install, and spaces to fill with furnishings (e.g. TV, cabinets, tables, etc).  Plus there's the remaining work in the studio, such as sound dampening panels (which will be homemade), shelving, etc.  </p>  <p>Hopefully I'll be posting some pictures soon.</p>
