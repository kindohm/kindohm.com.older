title: "The XBox 360 Product"

<p>In a way, I'm surprised the XBox 360 system has survived this long in the marketplace.  I just received a feedback email from someone who came to my site with this message:</p> <p style="margin: 20px"><em>"After 5 xbox repairs/swaps, I sold the 6th one returned to me from Customer Service to a friend for next to nothing and told him he had inherited the curse.  He could deal with Xbox service when it broke, which it did.  So, thinking I was smart, I went to compusa at the time, about 8 months ago, and bought a core system and a 2 year replacement plan so I could just swap systems if it failed.  Fast forward to this morning.  Red lights.  Go to compusa today to find that they were just sold to Tiger Direct and won't honor my replacement plan. I could friggin strangle someone!"</em></p> <p>Wow... retailers aren't even honoring the replacement plans because the product is so bad.  I know in this person's case it was a technicality that the replacement plan wasn't honored, but what a terrible situation to be in.</p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:f6c8bd2e-a19c-4c96-8fa3-6fd2954b1f3b">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/xbox%20360" rel="tag" target="_blank">xbox 360</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/repair" rel="tag" target="_blank">repair</a></div>
