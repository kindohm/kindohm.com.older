<p><img alt="Mike in Chicago" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3110/2537169629_e04fba94b8_m_d.jpg" align="right" border="0" /> Nikki and I spent three nights in Chicago last week.  </p>  <p>Highlights:</p>  <ul>   <li>Cubs game at Wrigley </li>    <li>Field Museum </li>    <li>Lake and River boat tour </li>    <li>Pulled BBQ chicken on Navy Pier </li>    <li>An insane amount of walking downtown </li> </ul>  <p>We were lucky to have some friends of ours offer to let us stay at their apartment in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview,_Chicago" target="_blank">Lakeview</a> neighborhood while they were out of town.  We were able to sample some of the tasty food nearby, including:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.loumalnatis.com/" target="_blank">Lou Malnati's</a> - very, very deep dish pizza </li>    <li><a href="http://www.nookiesrestaurants.net/" target="_blank">Nookie's Tree</a> - I actually opted for leftover pizza and Nikki ordered food from here, and now I regret it </li>    <li><a href="http://annsather.com/restaurants/locations.shtml" target="_blank">Ann Sather</a> - Disco Brunch on the first Sunday of every month.  Eggs, cinnamon rolls, and posters of the Village People, Donna Summer, and Rod Stewart everywhere.  </li> </ul>  <p>The Cubs game was pretty cool, as I've never seen a MLB game outside of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrodome" target="_blank">Metrodome</a>.  If you've never been to Wrigley Field, make an effort to go to a game if you ever get the chance.  I think what I liked the best is the lack of advertising.  Between innings, instead of seeing commercials and video advertisements on a big screen, there was only music and the sounds of the crowd.  There are some smaller scoreboards that show some basic text advertisements, but it's not like other places where the game breaks are dominated by blaring ads for Coke or a local newspaper.  The ballpark itself is of course fun too.  </p>  <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Museum" target="_blank">Field Museum</a> was pretty cool, but almost overwhelming.  There's way too much to look at in a day.  You'd probably need 1-2 weeks to look at everything there.  </p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:44bd8774-2bdf-4f52-bca2-38585a4082a8">Technorati Tags: <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tags/chicago" rel="tag">chicago</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tags/vacation" rel="tag">vacation</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tags/trip" rel="tag">trip</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tags/city" rel="tag">city</a></div>
