There have been rumors of this on blogs and message boards for a while.  Now it looks like a certainty.</p> <p>Naegele has built a great franchise so far, so it's disappointing to see him sell his stake in the team.  Who knows what the new owner (Craig Leipold) will be like.  A <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of Wild fans on the boards have voiced their anger over Leipold taking over, saying he'll ruin the franchise like he did with the Nashville Predators.  Exactly why these fans think that the Nashville franchise was "ruined" is a mystery to me.  Nashville is a solid team and has been in playoff contention consistently the last few years.  </p>  <p>As for Naegele - what a gold mine he's been sitting on.  I hope he takes a nice vacation with his profit :)</p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:549f8894-f3c7-4c19-84b7-587be2f7e095">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/wild" rel="tag" target="_blank">wild</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/hockey" rel="tag" target="_blank">hockey</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/nhl" rel="tag" target="_blank">nhl</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/naegele" rel="tag" target="_blank">naegele</a></div>
