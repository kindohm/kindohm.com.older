The conference was a good time and some interesting tidbits were learned - such as the fact that .NET WinForms is now officially a legacy technology.  At least that is how I interpreted it...  WinForms will not be advanced past .NET 2.0.  WPF is the new big kid on the block.</p> <p>And speaking of WPF, the DevCon WPF presentations were...  lacking.  I think the WPF presentations were geared toward audiences who had no WPF experience whatsoever - or had never even seen the technology.  The "ooohs" and "aaahs" from the audiences at some of WPF's basic 3D capabilities were surprising.</p> <p>Coming away from the conference, I got inspired to get creative with WPF and SharePoint data visualization.  We'll see what I come up with in the next year. </p> <p>At the suggestion of <a href="http://justaddcode.com" target="_blank">Neil</a>, I also began some work on a JavaScript implementation of <a href="http://codeplex.com/SPSearchBench" target="_blank">SharePoint Search Bench</a>.  I proved out the core functionality and now it is just a matter of making it useful.  This tool would be used to execute SharePoint searches easily in an Ajax setting.  </p> <p>I woke up today at 4:45 AM Pacific time to catch my flight, and got home at about 1:00 PM Central.  I'll be getting up around 5:00 AM tomorrow to catch a flight to Florida for a week-long vacation.  Then after we get back we'll be driving 3 hrs north to visit family for Thanksgiving.  I just won't be home much in November!</p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:5a9d9d53-5549-4b9a-a8c9-906a677db794">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.NET" rel="tag">.NET</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/DevConnections" rel="tag">DevConnections</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/sharepoint" rel="tag">sharepoint</a></div>
