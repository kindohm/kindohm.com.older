title: "Basement progress - painting and doors"
---

<p>This week we were all hit with colds (Eva is recovering from an ear infection) so we haven't made much progress on our basement painting.  Today we're going to try and finish it up though as we're feeling a little better.  </p> <p>It isn't much to look at yet, but here's the basement after being primed:</p> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/2213935896/" title="IMG_4636 by kindohm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2025/2213935896_533fda08af.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_4636" border="0" /></a></p> <p>Tomorrow Nikki's uncle is coming over to help install our four doors.  Come tomorrow evening I hope to have more pictures to share of some great progress!</p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:d1236faa-aaa1-47e9-8a76-8e59f2d83a54">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/basement" rel="tag" target="_blank">basement</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/project" rel="tag" target="_blank">project</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/recmodelling" rel="tag" target="_blank">recmodelling</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/painting" rel="tag" target="_blank">painting</a></div>
