<p>Songza is a music search engine.  Stream the results through your browser.  Send songs to Twitter, email them to a friend, or embed results on your web site.  The range of what Songza finds is just <em>average</em> - not a lot of rare stuff, but I love being able to click around and find other tunes/artists by accident while searching for something else.  Who knew there was a 50 Cent vs. Helmet track?  I didn't.</p>  <p>Sound illegal?  You can't download the songs, and Songza pays ASCAP for the rights to stream the music. It's completely legit and free for you and me.  </p>  <p>Here are some nice finds:</p>  <br /><embed src="http://songza.com/e/listen" width="425" height="114" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="zName=Enduser%20-%20Not%20so%20distant%20drums&amp;zId=j0k8-605F4A505559&amp;zAutostart=false&amp;zType=mp3" />   <br /> <br />  <object width="425" height="114"> <param name="movie" value="http://songza.com/e/listen" /> <embed src="http://songza.com/e/listen" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="114" flashvars="zName=Rick%20Astley%20-%20Never%20Gonna%20Give%20You%20Up&amp;zId=j0k8-665D4156505965&amp;zAutostart=false&amp;zType=mp3"> </embed></object>  <br /> <br /> <object width="425" height="114"> <param name="movie" value="http://songza.com/e/listen" /> <embed src="http://songza.com/e/listen" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="114" flashvars="zName=Murders%20%26%20Mysteries%20-%20The%20Restless%20%26%20Gifted&amp;zId=j0k4-BYseT67M3B3&amp;zAutostart=false&amp;zType=mp3"> </embed></object> <br /> <br />  <p>Have fun.</p>
