title: "Busted Keyboard"

<p>It's not a good thing when the tool of your trade, your lifeline to code, and the interface to your job is broken:</p>
<p><a href="http://kindohm.com/localimages/posts/BustedKeyboard_77C1/Picture82.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="244" alt="Picture 82" src="http://kindohm.com/localimages/posts/BustedKeyboard_77C1/Picture82_thumb.jpg" width="324" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I have no "F" key.  </p>
<p>I pop off keys almost daily.  I'm super aggressive when I type.  Seriously though - with this Dell D820 keyboard, the keys just have a little edge on them that my fingers occasionally catch on, and then the keys go flying.  </p>
<p>The difference in this case is that I can't actually get the key back on.  Usually I can just pop it back on, but this time it just won't stay on.  </p>
<p>So, I submitted a support request to get a new keyboard.  Now, I know that getting a new keyboard won't happen overnight, but I was a little disappointed when I got this response back from our support folks:</p>
<p><em>"On the under side of your D820 will be the Service Tag and Express Service code for your laptop; please make note of those and provide them to me. From there we'll be able to get the ball rolling on a replacement keyboard."</em></p>
<p>Get the ball rolling?  Ugh... this sounds like it will take a while.  </p>
