<p>I was thinking of writing up a post on using <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> versus traditional blogging and why I haven't been blogging much lately, but Scott Hanselman already summed up this topic very nicely:</p>
  
<p><b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2v7mkt">http://tinyurl.com/2v7mkt</a></b></p>
  
<p>All I really have to add to this topic is that I find myself more eager to open up twitter.com or a Twitter client than think of writing up a post for my site or opening up my RSS reader.  I'm not sure why that is yet, but I think Scott suggests some decent reasons.  His points may or may not be true in my case, but he makes some good ones nonetheless.</p>
