title: "Classic ASP.NET"
---

<p>My how technology goes fast.  Today I read this term for the first time: </p>
  
<p><em>Classic ASP.NET</em></p>
  
<p>Let that one sink in for a little bit.  </p>
  
<p>I came across the term in the comments of a blog post on ASP.NET MVC: <a title="http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/2008/01/26/displaying-foo-on-every-page-of-an-aspnet-mvc-application/" href="http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/2008/01/26/displaying-foo-on-every-page-of-an-aspnet-mvc-application/">http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/2008/01/26/displaying-foo-on-every-page-of-an-aspnet-mvc-application/</a>.  The commenter is referring to ASP.NET Web Forms.  </p>
  
<p>Of course, all of us good ASP.NET developers know that MVC is not a replacement for Web Forms.  The difference between Web Forms and MVC is <strong><em>not </em></strong>analogous to Classic ASP and Web Forms.  It is interesting to think of how ASP.NET MVC will be adopted though.  After playing with it for about a week, I really enjoy MVC's "back to HTML basics" feel - and it kind of makes developing web apps a little fun again.</p>
