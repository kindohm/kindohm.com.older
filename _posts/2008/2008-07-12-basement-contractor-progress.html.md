title: "Basement Contractor Progress"
---

<p>The contractors worked a full day today and got a lot done.  They installed all the baseboard casing along the doors and floor, build a custom electrical panel door, a custom window ledge, and a custom studio door threshold.  They'll be back on Monday to begin (if not finish) all of the painting.</p>
  
<p>I'm really pleased with their craftsmanship.  I could never have done it as quickly or as professionally as they did.  </p>
