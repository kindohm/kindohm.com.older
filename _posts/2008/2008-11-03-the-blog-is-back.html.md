<p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/TheBlogisBack_E4C4/onair.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="168" alt="onair" src="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/TheBlogisBack_E4C4/onair_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>After a few weeks of experimentation and deliberation, and after a week of development, I believe kindohm.com has reached a point of stability.  I've also settled on what I've wanted for the Hodnick storefront.  </p>
<p>First and foremost, I didn't see any way I could allow my blog to take a back seat to some other "home page".  If I ever were able to allow that, I decided I still wouldn't be satisfied with having a blog logically separated from the home page that may have a different design/brand.  Thus, I decided to bring the blog back and customize it to my liking - such that it had the storefront qualities I was looking for.  </p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a>.  My blog engine (<a href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a>) supports customizations through skinned ASP.NET user controls, and thus supports anything you can do with HTML, CSS, Javascript, or all of ASP.NET.  I decided that I wanted to pull in data from other services on the web such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Last.fm and show that information directly on my site - in addition to my blog content.  Through an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX" target="_blank">Ajax</a>-style approach with jQuery, I was able to easily pull in that data without having to perform significant .NET customizations - which was something I wanted to avoid if possible.  Now the kindohm.com home page is an aggregation of information from a number of sources - and redesigned to be more of a launching point than a page that just shows my recent blog posts.  </p>
<p>On the surface, the site doesn't look a whole lot different.  In a way it makes me feel kind of silly because I made a pretty big deal earlier about wanting to overhaul my site.  But while the design maybe hasn't changed, the data and purpose still have.</p>
<p>I'm expecting bugs and quirks to be uncovered now that it has been unleashed into the wild.  I'm sure jQuery will show some flaws with browser versions and operating systems I wasn't able to test.  jQuery in itself has been a joy to learn and develop with, and I hope to find more uses for it in the future.</p>
