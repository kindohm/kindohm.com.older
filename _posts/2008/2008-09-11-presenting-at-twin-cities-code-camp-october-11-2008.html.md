title: "Presenting at Twin Cities Code Camp October 11 2008"
---

<p>I'll be presenting at the <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> on October 11, 2008.  My topic will be on <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2008/Sessions.aspx#s30">WPF 3D Construction Basics</a>.  It's actually a topic I've presented on before, but I'll be making some changes and updating content to cover newer community tools and apps that are out there.  </p>
