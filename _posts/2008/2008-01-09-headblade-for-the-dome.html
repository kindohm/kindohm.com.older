title: "HeadBlade for the Dome"
---

<p><img height="188" src="http://www.headblade.com/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/HB_sport.jpg" width="250" align="right" />I picked up a <a href="http://www.headblade.com/" target="_blank">HeadBlade</a> last night.</p> <p>Another guy at work recommended one, suggesting it was really fast to use rather than a regular razor.  I hate shaving my head in the morning because it is time consuming.  I thought I'd try a HeadBlade since they're only $10.  </p> <p>I tried it out last night, and it was kind of strange to use at first.  I'll see how fast it really is to use after I get more familiar with using it.  But otherwise, it worked really well.  I have a nice, slick dome this morning.</p> <p>From the HeadBlade FAQ:</p> <p style="margin: 5px"><em>"I can't read. Do you have an illustration that shows how to use this smart little invention?"</em></p> <p>I like funny marketing people.</p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:8b9cac62-ce55-44eb-bcbf-c978b48990bc">Flickr Tags: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/headblade" rel="tag" target="_blank">headblade</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/shaving" rel="tag" target="_blank">shaving</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/head" rel="tag" target="_blank">head</a></div>
