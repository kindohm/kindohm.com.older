title: "Basement Update - Networking Progress"
---

<p>Yesterday I focused on completing all of the A/V and data hookups and made very good progress.  The simple parts were wiring up the coax cable outlets and the surround sound speaker outlets.  I knew that the CAT5 cable was going to take a bit more time, as those hookups are a little more tedious.  I finished all of them except for two.  Late last night, I decided to focus some energy on getting the networking "hub" in the basement closet complete.  That meant mounting my cable modem, router, and 16-port switch to the wall, wiring more CAT5 outlets, and fabricating a lot of CAT5 patch cables.  All that's left are about 5 more patch cables and to tidy up all of the electrical cables.  I'll wait and show some pictures after it's all done.</p>
<p>I also installed all of our HVAC vent covers and put on a toilet seat.  Gotta have a toilet seat.  </p>
