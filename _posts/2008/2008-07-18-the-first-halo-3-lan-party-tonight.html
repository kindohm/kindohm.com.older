title: "The First Halo 3 LAN Party Tonight?!"
---

<p><img src="http://www.counteragent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/halo3_multiplayer.jpg" width="300" align="right" />... at least in my circle of friends/coworkers/acquaintances (<a href="http://jasonbock.net/JB/Halo3LanPartySummer2008.aspx" target="_blank">see details here</a>).  Since <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> 3 came out last September, I've never played a game of it with anyone in person, let alone a big LAN party.  It's just more evidence that the game's fun has worn down over time.  You could argue that it's because of the game's online capabilities, but I disagree.  We got together for <strong><em>many</em></strong> Halo 2 parties, and that game also had online multiplayer gameplay.  After years and years of playing Halo: CE, Halo2, and now Halo 3, how many more games of CTF are really going to keep a large group of people coming back to play in person month after month?  It's still a great game, but the novelty and amazement of the Halo games wore off long ago.  This is all old news.  I'm just saying it all again.</p>  <p>That being said, if you asked me back in September that it would have taken this long to get together for a Halo 3 LAN party, I wouldn't have believed it.  There are so many cool features in the game - like multiplayer games <strong><em>with simultaneous Forge editing</em></strong>, custom editable maps, and saved films.  I've always wanted to try the simultaneous Forge-Gameplay experience, but still have never done it.</p>  <p>So, tonight I think there might be about 14 people with just as many XBox 360 Consoles.  It will probably be insane.  And crazy.  Both.  At the same time.  I packed my camera.  </p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:d33855f2-65e8-4cca-8caa-58d408a933c3">Technorati Tags: <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tags/halo" rel="tag">halo</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tags/xbox" rel="tag">xbox</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tags/halo3" rel="tag">halo3</a></div>
