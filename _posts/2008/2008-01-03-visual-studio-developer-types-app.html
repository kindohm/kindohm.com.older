You know, those great looking people who come up next to the bulleted lists of killer features in the version of Visual Studio that you're installing?"<br /><br />"I often wonder what type of programmers they are. Since they're shown in the product, they must use the product too, right? Are they C# developers? Do they dabble in VB.NET (what does 'Mort' look like anyway?). Visual Studio ships with C#, VB.NET, and C++, so they must be one of those three."</em></p> <p>With this app, you get to pick what language you think each of those stock photo models uses as their language of choice.  Perhaps you think the green-striped shirt guy is Mort.  The nerdy looking guy in the tan shirt has got to be a C++ guy, right?  </p> <p>I whipped up this dirty little app in a couple of late nights.  An ASP.NET blitz of sorts.... developed with VS 2k8 of course (while targeting .NET 2.0).  </p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b3089cd0-f407-49d3-ac88-3ecfaa495f36">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/visual%20studio" rel="tag" target="_blank">visual studio</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net" rel="tag" target="_blank">.net</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/asp.net" rel="tag" target="_blank">asp.net</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/programming" rel="tag" target="_blank">programming</a></div>
