title: "My blog and I are still friends"

<p>Hopefully you folks out there are sticking with me while I figure this out.  You are the victims of me having fun playing in the playground that is the internet.  </p>  <p>As I've been playing around with a few other blog-like tools, I'm finding that I can't replace my existing/old blog (that you are reading right now).  Some of you pointed this out to me a few days ago already :)  </p>  <p>What I'm still looking to change though is my "store front".  I still am not satisfied with the blog being the starting point.  It's one piece of a puzzle and I just don't want to give it special treatment.  I'm still experimenting and figuring this out with a hands-on approach.  In about a week and a half, <a href="http://www.tastynectar.com">www.tastynectar.com</a> will launch and I'm really curious to see what that might offer.  Maybe nothing... who knows.  </p>
