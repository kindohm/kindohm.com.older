title: "Google Charts API"
---

<p><a href="http://justaddcode.com" target="_blank">Neil</a> mentioned to me that Google just released a charting API.  I decided to check it out today and was very impressed - I didn't expect it to be completely URL-based!</p>
  
<p>The tinyurl below converts into a very, very long Url, and it's just too long to paste in here.  But if you click on it you'll see all of the text-encoded data that supports the chart data, which generates the chart below.</p>
  
<p><a href="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lxy&amp;chd=t:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20|31.90220632,32.27810399,32.89584385,30.00454339,33.24108742,35.04625736,32.89651674,30.53718342,29.61199295,32.38802014,27.78971494,31.12881806,28.32894352,29.53109815,30.41316337,27.21094856,30.23452953,28.71155243,28.05542935,29.91102582,30.6042885&amp;chs=500x400&amp;chco=ffff66&amp;chf=c,lg,45,999999,0,333333,0.75|bg,s,EFEFEF&amp;chds=0,21,26.21,36.05&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chxl=0:|6/13/2008|7/18/2008|8/6/2008|9/10/2008|10/8/2008|11/5/2008|1:|26.21|36.05&amp;chxs=0,666666,11,0&amp;chxp=1,5&amp;chtt=Mikes%20MPG&amp;chm=o,ffff66,0,-1,0&amp;chls=3,6,3" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/6z26s7</a></p>

<p>The data above represents the gas mileage for my Honda Accord over the past few months.</p>
  
<p>But the Google charting API...  it can do quite an array of chart types and styling that is pretty impressive.  Its documentation and details can be found at <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/apis/chart/</a></p>
