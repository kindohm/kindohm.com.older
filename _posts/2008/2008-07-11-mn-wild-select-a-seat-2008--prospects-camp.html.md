title: "MN Wild Select-a-Seat 2008 / Prospects Camp"
---

<p>Last night we went to the Minnesota Wild season ticket holder select-a-seat event.  We didn't pick new seats as everything we could afford was sold out - at least the pairs of seats.  There were a lot of single seats still available. </p>
  
<p>Usually, you get the opportunity to walk down on the arena floor and tour the MN Wild locker room after you're done looking at seats.  This year it was different as they were holding their annual Prospects Camp at the arena while the select-a-seat was going on.  So, we got to watch a little hockey!</p>

<p>This was Eva's first time at the Xcel Energy Center.  We go to games pretty often in the Winter and we always talk to her about where we go and about the games...  I'm not sure if she thought that <strong><em>this</em></strong> experience at the select-a-seat is what we do in the Winter or if she realizes that it's different when we usually go.  Either way, we hope to take her to at least one game this upcoming season.</p>
