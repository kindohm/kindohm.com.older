On one hand, how could you ever get rid of one of the most gifted and skilled hockey players on the planet?  On the other hand, he is injury-prone and hasn't proven himself for the amount of money he wants after his contract expires this season.  </p>  <p>I really don't think Gaborik can be the superstar player he thinks he is.  In this day, the NHL's superstars not only have offensive super skills but also skate and hit and grind their way through a game.  Today's good players also focus on defense and use good defense to create offensive opportunities.  Look at Wild players like Mikko Koivu - he's an offensive threat but is extremely physical and one of the most reliable defensive players on the team.  You'll rarely see Gaborik getting very physical or pulling off a "carry the team on my shoulders" effort.  Players like Sidney Crosby, Jarome Iginla, or Alexander Ovechkin can single-handedly take over a game.  Which leads me to my next point...</p>  <p>Gaborik is asking to be the one of the top-paid players in the NHL.  He's asking for contracts similar to what Vincent Lecavalier and Alexander Ovechkin have - a contract that would put him as one of the five highest-paid players in the league.  I really don't think he is one of the top five players in the league.  What has he proven?  He's proven that he's scored more than 40 goals once in his career.  What else?  He hasn't been effective in playoff games, nor has he demonstrated that he can single-handedly turn the tide in a game.  Exactly why does he think he's worth so much?</p>  <p>I think the Wild need to trade Gaborik quickly while there is still enough of a positive outlook on his career.  I'm also personally tired of the baggage that Gaborik carries with him - every time there are contract talks we get into this kind of a mess.  </p>  <p>We don't ever hear Gaborik's side of the story.  Maybe he or his agent don't want to tell it.  It may be just as simple as he doesn't want to play for Minnesota because of the team's style of play.  A more offensive-minded team may suit him better.  Is there anything wrong with saying that?  If I had to guess, I'd say that's the reason.  Unless he can make really big money, he probably doesn't want to stay in Minnesota.  With his history of injuries, who would take him?  Probably a playoff-bound team this year who needs added offense in the short term.  When his contract ends after he is traded somewhere else, I think he'll find himself in the same situation he is in now and he'll have a hard time getting the money he wants.</p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:76ddfee3-c224-480b-ad48-8f99773efb3b">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/hockey" rel="tag">hockey</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/nhl" rel="tag">nhl</a></div>
