<p>We are 100% done with painting!  This is another huge milestone in our basement project:</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4647 by kindohm, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/2224912346/"><img height="333" alt="IMG_4647" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2108/2224912346_3a796ae240.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The picture just doesn't capture the real color you see when you're in the space.  The flash just takes the color away.  Not that it's a dramatic color or anything...  it's just a little darker than what the picture shows.  </p>
<p>The blue tape on the floor marks where the sofa will be going....</p>
