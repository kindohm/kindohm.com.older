I'm also really bad at forming strong opinions on unpredictable things like sports, but here goes...  my Minnesota Wild 2008-2009 season predictions.</p>  <p>Let's start with the losses.  Brian Rolston, Pavol Demitra, and Mark Parrish are all gone (along with a handful of others).  With the exception of Rolston, I really don't think these losses matter.  First off, Demitra was virtually a non-factor last year as he only scored 15 goals.  He complained about Minnesota's constraining defensive system.  Hmmmm... somehow that didn't stop Gaborik and Rolston from scoring over 40 and 30 goals respectively last year.  Demitra is past his prime, and isn't a big loss as far as I'm concerned.  </p>  <p>The one thing that Demitra could do though was feed the puck to Marian Gaborik.  Enter Andrew Brunette.  The Wild signed Brunette early this off-season, admitting it was a mistake to let him go a few years ago.  Brunette is like Demitra except Canadian.  He's got great hands and great vision for those needle-threading passes in the goal crease.</p>  <p>So what about recovering from the loss of Rolston?  He was a 31-goal scorer last season.  Well, the Wild couldn't convince Marian Hossa to come to Minnesota.  Instead, they settled for Owen Nolan, who is more like a replacement for Parrish.  That's 15 goals unaccounted for with the loss of Rolston.</p>  <p>Where I think the Wild will really see gains this year is in its older first-round draft picks: Mikko Koivu, Pierre Marc-Bouchard, James Sheppard, and Brent Burns will be noticeably improved this season.  Koivu showed signs of stunning offensive ability last year (can you say monster deke?).  An improvement from these four across the board will make up for the other 15 goals difference between Rolston and Nolan.  </p>  <p>There is also the addition of a rookie forward in Colton Gillies.  He is unproven, but he is a really big guy and has had good success in his junior leagues.  Big + offensive ability = win.</p>  <p>Benoit Pouliot is also going to make his starting roster debut this season.  He has offensive flair that has yet to be seen in the NHL - my gut tells me he'll either be an offensive menace or a flop.  50/50 chance.  I'll leave him out as a non-factor this season.  </p>  <p>On defense, the Wild have picked up Marc-Andre Bergeron and Marek Zidlicky.  With the defensemen that the Wild have lost, I'll say that their defensive acquisitions are a wash.  However, Zidlicky is a huge offensive threat - which is arguably a step forward.  Losing Keith Carney was tough - he's old but always had a good +/- rating.</p>  <p>The goaltending situation hasn't really changed.  I'm not 100% confident in Niklas Backstrom.  His shootout percentage is bad, and the Wild found themselves in shootouts often last season.  With the Wild's defensive style, I don't see that changing.  If Backstrom flops, we'll see more of Josh Harding who so far has looked decent in his short NHL career. </p>  <p>In summary, while the Wild have lost some offensive talent, I think think it will be made up for with improved young talent this year.  I don't see the overall performance of the team changing this year at all.  However, I don't predict a repeat of the first-place Northwest Division finish.  I think that spot is reserved for Calgary - who can beat the Wild most days of the week, and the Wild can never stop Jarome Iginla.  </p>  <p>I think the Wild will make the playoffs, but again will lose in the first round.  The hardcore fans will be angry and demand the firing of coach Lemaire and general manager Risebrough.  Fire Lemaire?  Maybe.  Sure.  I don't think that changes much though.  I think Risebrough knows what he is doing though.  The Wild aren't even 10 years old yet, and now they are beginning to consistently appear in the playoffs.  Their older draft class talent is <em>just</em> coming into their best years!  Maybe I'm just more patient than most.  </p>  <p>I'd love to see the Wild go deeper in the post-season, but I don't see it happening.  The loss of Rolston and the inability of the Wild to sign another offensive threat will hold them back just that much.</p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:6752c872-410d-4942-81e9-d0d84d5a296e">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/hockey" rel="tag">hockey</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/nhl" rel="tag">nhl</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/mn%20wild" rel="tag">mn wild</a></div>
