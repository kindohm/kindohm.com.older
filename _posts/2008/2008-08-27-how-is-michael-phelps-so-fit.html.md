title: "How is Michael Phelps so Fit?"
---

<p>I saw this image advertisement on Facebook yesterday:</p>
  
<p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/posts/HowisMichaelPhelpssoFit_93D1/phelps.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="247" alt="phelps" src="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/posts/HowisMichaelPhelpssoFit_93D1/phelps_thumb.png" width="166" border="0" /></a> </p>
  
<p>I wish I would have come up with the idea for the business behind this marketing campaign.  Get people to ask you how to get in shape like an athlete.  Charge $50 and send them an informational packet consisting of a Post-It note with these instructions:</p>
  
<ol>   
<li>Eat right</li>    
<li>Quit your day job and exercise and train all day</li> 
</ol>  
<p>Why am I not a millionaire yet?</p>
