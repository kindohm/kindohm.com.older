<p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/posts/TargetRats_AD35/Target.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="201" alt="Target" src="http://www.kindohm.com/localimages/posts/TargetRats_AD35/Target_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a> The term "<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mallrat">Mall Rat</a>" is a bit dated, but I've discovered a new breed: Target Rats.  What exactly is a Target Rat?  A Target Rat is the same as a Mall Rat, except Target Rats live in outer-ring suburbs where there are no malls.  Instead, Target Rats hang out at <a href="http://www.target.com">Target</a>.  </p>  <p>Ha ha ha.  Very funny Hodnick.  Very clever.  </p>  <p>I'm dead serious - the Target Rat phenomena is in full force in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=chaska,+mn&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr">Chaska, MN</a>.  </p>  <p>Yesterday, I observed a variety of Target Rats at the Chaska Super Target:</p>  <ol>   <li>Three teenagers talking and "hanging out" in the produce section. </li>    <li>Two teenagers sitting and gossiping on a bench near the cash registers. </li>    <li>A large group of teenagers eating at Food Avenue (Target's in-store eatery). </li>    <li>A small group of teenagers convening and talking outside the entrance (green side). </li> </ol>  <p>None of the kids looked like they were just passing through and paused to stop and talk to a friend who they happened to see.  It also seemed very unlikely that this large quantity of teenagers just happened to be there with their parents and they all started mingling and hanging out at the store since they were already there.    Instead, I believe that Target has become a prioritized destination among bored adolescents.  It's just too far to drive to the closest mall.  </p>  <p>I think Target could capitalize on this.  I smell a money-maker.  Any entrepreneurs out there?</p>  <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:da1405b7-f8d1-4fab-83a6-2dd1a033db3b">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/target" target="_blank" rel="tag">target</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/mall" target="_blank" rel="tag">mall</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/shopping" target="_blank" rel="tag">shopping</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/kids" target="_blank" rel="tag">kids</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/bored" target="_blank" rel="tag">bored</a></div>
