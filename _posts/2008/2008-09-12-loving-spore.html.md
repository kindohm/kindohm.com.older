title: "Loving Spore"

<p>Nikki literally, and I mean literally, tried to pull me away from the game last night so I could go to bed.</p>
  
<p>Forget trying to make progress in the game... I just think the game's premise is awesome: evolve in a massive universe where the decisions you make <em>permanently </em>affect gameplay in the future.  But that's not even the best part.  Personally, the Spore "Creator" is what I like the best.  The Creator is actually a focal point of the game - as you evolve and take on new abilities, you are <em>forced</em> to use the creator to create creatures, houses, factories, land/water/air vehicles, and spacecraft.  The Creator is the most addicting part of it.  </p>
  
<p>Here's my X-Wing/Tie-Fighter hybrid:</p>

<p>To each his own...  I'm sure other folks probably think the Creator is boring.</p>
  
<p>I've reached the "Space" phase, and the environment you can explore appears to be massive.  It seems as though the previous four phases are just introductory phases.  The Space phase is the real game.  Or so it seems for now....  I haven't been in the Space phase for long.</p>
  
<p>Spore has been referred to as a "massively single-player online game".  It is true.  Creations from your friends show up in your game.  Creations from "Sporecasts" that you subscribe to show up in your game.  With some control, you can have the content from creators all over the world show up in your game - creatures, buildings, vehicles, etc.  </p>
  
<p>I don't think I've played a game this much since <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> 2.  </p>
