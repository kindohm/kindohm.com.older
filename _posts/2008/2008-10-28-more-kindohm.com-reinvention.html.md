title: "More kindohm.com Reinvention"

<p><img height="158" src="http://signaturesterling.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ajax.jpg" width="200" align="right" />By forcing myself to use my blog and domain in a new way, it has kept me thinking about how I use my domain, blog, and other web tools to create a web presence.  The longer I live without my blog being my starting point or home page, the more I value it.  That doesn't mean I want my blog to go back to being my home for my domain though...</p>
  
<p>A colleague of mine suggested that it is more about using the right tool for the job rather than committing yourself to a certain set of tools for all purposes.  About a week ago, I was ready to ditch this blog and put all of my energy into <a href="http://kindohm.tumblr.com" target="_blank">kindohm.tumblr.com</a>.  Looking back, it's almost funny to think I wanted to do that.  Tumblr is an awesome web app, but it's more like a scrapbook than a journal or blog.  I like the fact that I can post quick messages, links, pictures, or video on Tumblr without distracting from the real meaty content on my blog.  Tumblr has also been great for slurping in content from other apps, and vice-versa.  Tumblr is just another node out there with an RSS interface - and it is recognized by other apps.</p>
  
<p>So what is my next idea-of-the-week?  Right now, kindohm.com is a static page with very little content.  It is merely a landing page that will take you to my blog or other apps.  Very quickly I'm starting to dislike that there is very little data on the landing page.  It's kind of annoying that you have to go to the landing page <strong><em>first</em></strong> to get to something useful.  Instead, I'd like the landing page to present an aggregation of all the latest stuff - blog posts, pictures, twitters, links, etc.  I'll have to do it creatively - there isn't a lot of real-estate available on a singe page to include all that stuff.  I'll probably open up a can of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX" target="_blank">Ajax</a> on the page :)  </p>
  
<p>Ultimately, I'm not sure what is going to happen with Tumblr.  The new landing page may render it useless.  Either way, I'll continue with this head-first approach in reinventing my web site and web presence.  It isn't as radical as I thought it would be, but I'm enjoying seeing things differently.</p>
