title: "Farseer Physics Engine in Silverlight + Data"
---

<p>This week I picked up the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/FarseerPhysics" target="_blank">Farseer Physics Engine</a>, which <a href="http://justaddcode.com" target="_blank">Neil</a> showed me a while back.  In my efforts to create an interesting data visualization experience (e.g. <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2008/08/25/connectable-lines-and-shapes-in-silverlight.aspx" target="_blank">Connectable Lines</a>, <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2008/08/13/radial-network-graph-in-silverlight.aspx" target="_blank">Radial Network Graph</a>), I've wanted a UI that could "distribute itself" on the screen.  I wanted something that looked natural that could space itself out.  I needed the ability to introduce forces (attraction and repulsion) between UI elements.</p> <p>By picking up Farseer I was able to accomplish what I wanted and created what looks like a "molecule" of UI elements:</p> <p><a title="http://www.kindohm.com/sl/molecules/molecules.htm" href="http://www.kindohm.com/sl/molecules/molecules.htm" target="_blank">http://www.kindohm.com/sl/molecules/molecules.htm</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/FarseerPhysicsEngineinSilverlightData_8671/Untitled2.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="401" alt="Untitled2" src="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/FarseerPhysicsEngineinSilverlightData_8671/Untitled2_thumb.png" width="504" border="0" /></a> </p> <p>This may sound a little surprising - but there really isn't any interesting code to post on this! The Farseer engine takes care of everything. The UI and body/geometry logic is not much different than what Farseer already provides in its example applications and in the documentation.  Place a couple of items, join them with a linear spring.  Done.  I won't say that the UI is trivial, but like I said, there are already other examples out there.  </p> <p>As for my first impressions of Farseer, I don't have any experience with other physics engines so I can't be too critical.  I found it easy enough to use and tweak to my likings, and I look forward to using it more.  I haven't come across any bugs yet with collisions or anything else.</p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:675757f9-a226-49f6-aa2a-6a76a63c339b">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/silverlight" rel="tag">silverlight</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/code" rel="tag">code</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/programming" rel="tag">programming</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/wpf" rel="tag">wpf</a></div>
