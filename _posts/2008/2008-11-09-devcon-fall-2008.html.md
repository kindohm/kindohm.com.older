title: "DevCon Fall 2008"

<p>I'll be flying out to Las Vegas on Monday to attend the Fall 2008 Dev Connections conference.  I'm really hoping that there will be some material from PDC that creeps in to the presentations, but I really doubt it since the presenters have had their material approved for presenting months ago - and PDC was only a few weeks ago.  Who knows though - there's always the keynote and that could have a few surprises.  </p>
