<P>This bugs me:</P> <P><EM><CODE>Please wait while your personal site is setup for the first time and the default document libraries and lists are created. This may take several seconds.</CODE></EM></P> <P>This is the message that SharePoint displays when creating a user's <EM>My Site</EM>. "Setup" is not a verb, damnit. If you don't believe me, <A href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=setup&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target=_blank>ask Webster</A>. I've been seeing this everywhere lately. Advertisements, documents, articles, and in applications. I care enough about you and your grammar that I'm spending the time to point this out [1]. So please, say "set up" when you are setting something up. </P> <P>[1] Plus, I'm sophisticated (so says <A href="http://www.developstuff.com/" target=_blank>Jake</A>). I iron my shirts, have a rain coat, and go to concert band rehearsals on Mondays.</P>
