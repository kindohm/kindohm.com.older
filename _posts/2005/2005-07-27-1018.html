title: "MN Wild Season Tickets"
---

<P>We've already renewed our Wild season tickets for the next season, and our date for select-a-seat is August 2nd.&nbsp; If history repeats itself, there won't be any better seats at the same price to choose from, but the renewal rate was a little lower this year at 91%, so there's a slightly better chance that we could improve our seats.&nbsp; I'm not counting on it though.&nbsp; </P> <P>While there may not be too much of a point in going to the select-a-seat, we always make an event out of going and it's a lot of fun.&nbsp; Nikki and I share the&nbsp;tickets with <A href="http://www.leejsackett.com">Lee</A> and his wife Shannon, and the four of us usually go have something to eat at <A href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2005-02,GGLD:en&amp;q=mcgoverns&amp;near=Saint+Paul,+MN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=locald&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=44944444,-93093056,5318101103428316438">McGovern's</A> before going to the arena.&nbsp; Being at the arena is always a good time.&nbsp; The ice is gone and you can walk on the playing surface and imagine what it's like to skate on the ice during a game.&nbsp; The <A href="http://www.xcelenergycenter.com/">X</A> is a beautiful place inside and out.&nbsp; The staff also lets you walk into the locker room and some other &#8220;hidden&#8221; places in the arena.&nbsp; If fans are lucky, one of the players might even be around to say hi.</P> <P>Ticket prices are going to stay the same from last season (before the lockout).&nbsp; A <STRONG>lot</STRONG> of fans are very unhappy about this.&nbsp; The main point being made is that if player salaries are being rolled back almost 25%, then why aren't ticket prices being rolled back that much?&nbsp; It was the owners' decision to lock out the players and ultimately cancel the season and the fans suffered through a season without the sport.&nbsp; Fans want to be compensated for losing a season of the NHL.</P> <P>Why aren't the Wild rolling back prices?&nbsp; They aren't because there are 6,500 fans on the waiting list for season tickets.&nbsp; If unhappy season ticket holders decide not to renew their tickets, there will be plenty of people in line to pick them up.&nbsp; Teams in non-traditional hockey markets won't have that luxury and will need to lower prices to bring back fans.&nbsp; While it was very unfortunate that last season had to be cancelled, the Wild franchise is still a business.&nbsp; It's supply and demand, and from a business perspective it makes sense.</P> <P>The Wild are already going to pick up the tab for season ticket holders for the first game of the season.&nbsp; They've showered season ticket holders with gifts throughout the lockout (e.g. DVDs, hats, etc).&nbsp; They're organizing some large events before the season starts and on the opening night of the season.&nbsp; In my opinion, the Wild have been very reasonable about pricing and the small extra benefits they've provided.&nbsp; Ultimately the quality of the product on the ice should go up too (given the new rule changes and upcoming young talent).</P> <P>Some people just have to find something to complain about, I guess.&nbsp; I'm ecstatic about the upcoming season and the return of the NHL.  I can't wait to see how the new rules affect the game and to see the Wild's new, young talent on the ice.  I just don't have any complaints about the price to pay for what's coming up this season.</P>
