title: "Next two concerts"
---

<p>The <a href="http://www.medalistband.com/">Medalist band</a> will be playing a couple of holiday concerts in the next few weeks.&nbsp; One is tonight at the Bloomington Fine Arts Center, but it's $10.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;a complete rip off considering we're playing a FREE concert on December 5th.&nbsp; The holiday music just isn't worth $10 when you can hear oodles of free holiday music in a lot of places all December.&nbsp; If we were playing more of a standard show featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Grainger">Grainger</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-02%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22frank+ticheli%22">Ticheli</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-02%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22jack+stamp%22">Stamp</a>, then I'd say it'd be worth the $10.&nbsp; The holiday stuff is fun, but it's not the most interesting from a musical standpoint, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If anyone on the Medalist's board of directors reads this post, they'll be pissed, because our $10 shows&nbsp;are how we raise a lot of money.&nbsp; But why bother rehearsing and performing if nobody is going to show up?&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, come to the free show on December 5th at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=7700+York+Avenue+South,+Edina,+MN+55435&amp;spn=0.018407,0.034287&amp;hl=en">Edinborough Park</a> (yes, it's indoors).&nbsp; I just looked at the Medalist's <a href="http://www.medalistband.com/schedule/schedule.html">online schedule</a> and they don't have a time for the show, but it'll probably be at 7:30.&nbsp; </p>
