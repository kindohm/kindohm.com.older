<P><A href="http://www.thn.com/en/headlines/detail.asp?id=27865&amp;cat=954945254360" target=_blank>http://www.thn.com/en/headlines/detail.asp?id=27865&amp;cat=954945254360</A></P> <P>With respect to the the NHL trying to increase offence and broaden the interest of the game, this idea and article&nbsp;are the best that I have seen.&nbsp; The author of the concept makes some good points about how other proposed&nbsp;game enhancements, such as eliminating the red line, will not be effective as they rely on the presumption that you can compute the probability of a&nbsp;single event (e.g. a single shot on goal).&nbsp; This author's idea aims to actually&nbsp;change the probability of the outcome of many shots on goal.&nbsp; His article is based on facts and sources - not assumptions and gut-instinct as most of the NHL's proposed rule changes have been.</P>
