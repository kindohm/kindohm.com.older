<P>I picked up a few CD's last night. I highly recommend both:</P> <TABLE cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=2 width="100%" border=0> <TBODY> <TR> <TD vAlign=top><A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000DJYNS/qid=1110035339/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8290753-6939363?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846" target=_blank><IMG src="http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/8d/20/2cd39330dca02a22163a1010.M.jpg" border=0></A> </TD> <TD style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt" vAlign=top><B>Hatebreed - <I>The Rise of Brutality</I></B>. This one's been on my list for a long time. An improvement of their prior release, <I>Perseverence</I>. The production is better and it's heavier. The guitar riffs were constructed for pure heaviness and power. Not as much shred-tempo tunes on this one, which I am glad about. Only downside is that I'd like to see a little more variation in the how the tunes sound. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE> <TABLE cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=2 width="100%" border=0> <TBODY> <TR> <TD vAlign=top><A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000777J9G/qid=1110035407/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-8290753-6939363" target=_blank><IMG src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000777J9G.01._PE14_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" border=0></A></TD> <TD style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt" vAlign=top><B>Low- <I>The Great Destroyer</I></B>. Low is from my hometown and I'm glad to see that they're still going strong. This disc is a huge change in their sound - they've always been known for their minimalist/slow-core sound, but this is nothing like their old stuff. Alan and Mimi's vocals sound stronger than ever, and I absolutely love the smooth and warm but heavily distorted guitars. The production is excellent and the mixing is creative. Go take a listen on Amazon. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
