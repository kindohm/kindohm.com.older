title: "Just like old times - Halo - CE"

<P>One of the benefits of <A href="http://www.inetium.com" target=_blank>where I work</A> is our <FONT color=#a52a2a>*</FONT>Brain Lounge: a place to sit on a couch, fire up an XBox, unwind and let your developer troubles go away for a few minutes.&nbsp; </P> <P><A href="http://www.whoisjake.com" target=_blank>Jake</A> and I fired up some good ol' Halo: Combat Evolved for a couple of duels.&nbsp; That was the first time I've played Halo CE since, oh, maybe September or so.&nbsp; I was expecting to be a bit suprised at the difference in the game's feel compared to Halo 2, and it definately took a bit of getting used to.&nbsp; For a few moments it felt really foreign, but it was very interesting to observe some of the game subtleties (or lack thereof) in comparison to Halo 2.&nbsp; Less crisp graphics, sloppier movoement, different physics...&nbsp; and no dual wielding! :)</P> <P>I lost 15-6 in Slayer on Prisoner (damn those health-reducing falls), and lost 25-21 in Rockets on Prisoner.&nbsp; </P> <P>Vintage.</P> <P><FONT color=#a52a2a>*</FONT> The &#8220;Brain Lounge&#8221; isn't officially named yet.&nbsp; We <EM>supposedly</EM> had a naming contest for our conference rooms, but it's been weeks and there are no results.&nbsp; Something's fishy...</P>
