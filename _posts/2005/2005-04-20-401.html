title: "Auto Update - no excuse for intelligent gameplay"
---

<P>The last couple of nights I've been on XBox Live playing lots of matchmade Halo 2 Team Slayer games with 3 other friends.&nbsp; Like most gamers who play a lot of H2, I've been trying to pay close attention to the differences that the Auto Update has made to gameplay.&nbsp; The biggest differences that have become known in the H2 community are:</P> <UL> <LI>Grenades are more powerful</LI> <LI>Melee attacks are more powerful</LI> <LI>Certain weapons have been downgraded (e.g. Magnum)</LI></UL> <P>Perhaps the most noticeable effect that these changes have is that there is a larger trade-off when choosing to dual-wield.&nbsp; This is because the dual-wield combination is affected by a downgraded weapon and you cannot use the more powerful grenades.</P> <P>Most people I play with and have talked to agree that these game changes are significant.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; While each change on its own is noticeable in the game, they don't affect gameplay strategies and tactics - which I think are much more important to win.&nbsp; I don't care if you're trying to use melee attacks and grenades more - if your team isn't communicating or organized then you will lose.&nbsp;&nbsp;The survivors of a battle are usually determined by&nbsp;how the battle was approached in the first place.&nbsp; Weapon selection is still important, but mostly&nbsp;on a macro-level (e.g.&nbsp;the team with the rockets and sword will be tougher to beat) and not so much on the micro-level (e.g. the details that the Auto Update changed).&nbsp; </P>
