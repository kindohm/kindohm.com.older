title: "The New Halo 2 Maps"

<p>There must be thousands of blog posts out there today commenting on the new maps.&nbsp; So, in order to not be a complete unoriginal clone, I'm going to ensure that this post is unique:</p> 

<p align="center">

<p align="left">There.&nbsp; Now, if someone else out there commenting on the new Halo 2 maps also has the word 'alpacas' in bright colors and varying typeface in their post, let me know.</p> 
<p align="left">I came home after work yesterday and had a few minutes to download the maps and walk around them a little bit.&nbsp; This experience was a little dull as I had already seen the <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/04/23/412.aspx">RvB map walkthroughs</a> a few days earlier.&nbsp; I went to <a href="http://www.medalistband.com/">Medalist</a> rehearsal and then came home and played some custom games with a few friends.&nbsp; Here's my take:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<div align="left"><strong>Warlock</strong> - It's &#8220;Wizard&#8221; from Halo: CE, but it's better because its appearance is different.&nbsp; I really like the more organic &#8220;ruins&#8221; type of feel.&nbsp; The powerups in the map are also different from the original, and I think that also improves the gameplay (there's only one in the map rather than 4).&nbsp; An excellent map for Ball and King.</div></li> 
<li> 
<div align="left"><strong>Containment</strong> - I only got to walk around in this map on my own as I wasn't a part of a large enough party to play a decent game on this one.&nbsp; What I really like is the complexities of the bases: the moveable gates and the multiple entrances on foot (the side tunnels or over the wall).&nbsp; This is a gift to well-organized offences, and a headache for defences or poorly organized offences.&nbsp; Maybe the best feature about Containment is the tank mines: 1) you can slide them around when on foot, 2) make them blow up, 3) and change the pitch of their humming with each single round that you shoot them with.&nbsp; Sweet.</div></li> 
<li> 
<div align="left"><strong>Sanctuary</strong> - I really want to like this map.&nbsp; I love the setting and again the &#8220;ruins&#8221; look and feel.&nbsp; The map is a nice medium size with plenty of paths, passages, corners, bridges, and hiding places.&nbsp; Lots of variety for slayer and plenty of options for strategies in objective-based games.&nbsp; There's a large variety of weapons too.&nbsp; I only got to play this one once, and my team (outnumbered 4 to 3) got schooled.&nbsp; Because of the number of high-up places on this map, you can control the whole board if you put enough people with long/medium range weapons up high.&nbsp; </div></li> 
<li> 
<div align="left"><strong>Turf</strong> - Lots of nooks and crannies to hide in, and lots of high ground with a big field of vision for sniping.&nbsp; To me it seems that the vertical playing field is utilized on this entire map.&nbsp; Rather than just having a few towers or bridges, there is a second level on this map that is almost always directly above the first.&nbsp; Lots of obstacles, hallways, and corners.&nbsp; Not a lot to say on this one yet, but it definately has a very unique feel compared to the rest of the H2 maps.</div></li></ul> 
<p align="left">Now, only a few months until the rest of them...</p>
