title: "New H2 Map Walkthroughs (videos)"
---

<p>Kinda late to post this, and Bungie already posted it, but it's cool enough that I'm going to too.&nbsp; If you haven't already, check out the walkthroughs of the new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvsblue.com/archive/">H2 maps on redvsblue.com</a>&nbsp;(scroll to the bottom on that page to see them).&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'm not going to form an opinion on them until I play them, but Containment (the big one) looks pretty awesome.&nbsp; Kinda like a cross between Coagulation and Zanzibar.&nbsp; It's big and kinda laid out like Coagulation, but has the interesting features of Zanzibar (remote controlled base gates, multiple routes of entry, etc).&nbsp; Plus it has tank mines.&nbsp; Tank mines?&nbsp; Yes, tank mines.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On a different note, it looks like Bungie is lowering their tolerance for cheating, cursing, screaming, boosting, being an idiot, etc.&nbsp; Their last <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=weeklywhatsapril22&amp;p=3106844">weekly update</a> talks about it, and honestly I didn't think they would take it this far.&nbsp; Who knows if they'll actually enforce it.&nbsp; It'd be nice if they do.&nbsp; The best part of the update are the last two sentences of the last paragraph:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Look, most of you know what cheating is, so quit asking stupid questions about it, or acting indignant because there is a bug in the game that you felt obliged to exploit. YOU ARE CHEATING. We don't even owe you this explanation. The only reason we bother is so that we can go back and say look, we told you this was cheating and you're BANNED so shut up. And I hope you get boils. And I hope the boils are full of acid-spewing spiders that burst out and hump your face.&#8221;</em></p>
