<p style="font-size: 150%;"><span style="color: red;">UPDATE</span>  <a href="http://www.halo3basics.com" target="_blank">Visit the all new Halo3Basics.com</a> for Halo 3 multiplayer tips and strategies.</p>  <p>I stumbled across a quick and useful video of some advanced Halo 2 multiplayer techniques (download link below).  I'm starting to get into a Halo 2 mode again and this video spurred a little more interest.  I thought it was going to be a snoozer when it started out with some melee tips, but got interesting with some melee combos (just something I never really thought of).  Some good demos of sword dodging and sweep sniping.  Produced with a great Nine Inch Nails remix behind it.</p> <p><a href="http://files2.bungie.org/stratguide/AdvancedCombatTechniques.wmv">Download the video</a>  Save the link to your local computer.
