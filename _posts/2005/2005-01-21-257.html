title: "I can&#39;t complain anymore"

<P>Looks like I can't <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/01/19/243.aspx">complain</A> anymore.&nbsp; See images below.&nbsp; It snowed like a banshee today, and it's still going.&nbsp; It's supposed to snow for like another 12 hours.&nbsp; This totally rules.&nbsp; The only downside is that Nikki and I missed the home opener for the <A href="http://www.mnswarm.com/" target=_blank>Minnesota Swarm</A> tonight as a result of the snow and bad driving.&nbsp; It took me one hour and 45 minutes to get from Chaska to Edina to pick her up to go to the game.&nbsp; We decided it'd take another 2 or 3 hours just to get to the game and probably miss a bit of it, so we decided to do something else.&nbsp; </P> <P>When we got home I took the snowblower out and helped some neighbors with their driveways, then our next-door neighbor Jason brought out a couple of beers and we chatted for a bit.&nbsp; Great guy.&nbsp; Thanks Jason!</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/bigsnow01.jpg"></P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/bigsnow02.jpg"></P>
