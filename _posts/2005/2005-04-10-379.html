Nikki and I are back from our trip to <STRIKE>the Caribbean</STRIKE> Antarctica.&nbsp; Details&nbsp;will follow in the form of multiple blog postings in the near future, including why I have the shape of a spoon on the left side of my head.&nbsp; There'll be pictures too.&nbsp; It's good to be back.
