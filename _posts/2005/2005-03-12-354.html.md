title: "Basement Update"
---

<p>Lots&nbsp;of progress so far today:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Rebuilt a return-air enclosure in the music room</li> 
<li>Ran cable for the last circuit (the &#8220;TV&#8220; circuit)</li> 
<li>Ran two CAT-V cables to the music room</li> 
<li>Tightened up and tacked down all of the misc. loose cables I've put in over the last month</li></ul> 
<p>Right now I need to make an executive decision on how the electrical, audio, and CAT-V outlets will be oriented in the TV corner.&nbsp; There's not a lot of room to work with in that area.</p>
<p>If I'm ambitious enough I'll also make a trip to Home Depot to get a bathroom fan and some speaker wire.&nbsp; It's starting to get late in the day though, so I may not get that far.&nbsp; Otherwise, here's my final &#8220;to-do&#8221; list before the first inspection:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Re-route some of the original electrical circuits</li> 
<li>Install the bathroom fan and wire up the bathroom</li> 
<li>Cut a hole in the house and run the bathroom fan exhaust to the outside</li> 
<li>Wire up the TV circuit</li> 
<li>Build the &#8220;big mother&#8220; soffit</li> 
<li>Install recessed lighting and other light boxes in the &#8220;big mother&#8220; soffit</li> 
<li>Install insulation.&nbsp; </li></ul> 
<p>With some luck I'll have the first half of that list done next weekend.&nbsp; Tomorrow I'll be helping one of Nikki's uncles lay down wood flooring in their house, so I won't make any progress tomorrow.&nbsp; After we lay flooring, it'll be a Halo 2 smackdown.&nbsp; </p>
