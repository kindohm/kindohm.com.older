title: "Standing here with my demo"
---

<P>I came across an old demo of &#8220;Standing Here For Days&#8221;&nbsp;from the <EM><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/FuryStopper.aspx">Fury Stopper</A></EM> sessions.&nbsp; I haven't heard this in a long time.&nbsp; It's basically the first take I ever did with the song.&nbsp; I'll be damned if I can ever capture the drums on tape like that again.&nbsp; I remember that I recorded the guitars directly into my Yamaha AW16g without using any external preamp or anything - just plugged directly into the board.&nbsp; I used the AW16g's onboard amplifier simulation for the final guitar sound.&nbsp; The vocals sound pretty decent.&nbsp; Despite the lame guitar tone, the mix as a whole is pretty good, and I think I like it better than the final track on the CD.</P> <UL> <LI><A href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Fury%20Stopper/Demos%20and%20B-Sides/Kindohm.Fury%20Stopper%20-%20Demos%20and%20B%20Sides%20-%20Standing%20Here%20For%20Days%20-%20Original%20Demo.mp3">Download the Standing Here For Days Demo (5.6 MB)</A>  <LI><A href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Fury%20Stopper/Kindohm-Fury%20Stopper-11-Standing%20Here%20For%20Days.mp3">Download and compare the final Standing Here For Days track on the Fury Stopper CD (3.6 MB)</A></LI></UL> <P>That sweet, trashy hi-hat you hear on the demo is a 14&#8220; Zildjian New Beat on top with an old, cracked 16&#8220; Wuhan on the bottom.&nbsp; </P> <P>I also came across the very first track I ever recorded with the AW16g.&nbsp; It's a remake of &#8220;<A href="http://wss.kindohm.com/OS/Kindohm-OS-12-Snow.mp3">Snow</A>&#8221; off of the <EM><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/OS.aspx">OS</A> </EM>CD.&nbsp; <A href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Basic/Demos,%20B-Sides/Kindohm.Basic%20-%20Demos,%20B%20Sides.06.Snow%20-%20AW16g%20Mix.mp3">Download the Snow Remake mp3 here</A>.&nbsp; </P>
