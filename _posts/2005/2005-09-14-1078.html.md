title: "Preseason starts Saturday"
---

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.leejsackett.com">Lee</a> and I got together on Monday night to divide up our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wild.com">Wild</a> season tickets.  We already have a game to go to this Saturday.  Wow.  The season came here fast.</p>
<p>Even though it's just a preseason game, it'll be nice to get into the arena, see the ice, and watch a game after such a long absence of the NHL.  Plus, it's a great time to watch the Wild's prospects and other players trying out for the team before the regular season starts.  I remember last season <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wild.com/team/002/402/">Matt Foy</a> made his debut in a preseason game with the Wild.  He looked like he had some good skill and a lot of potential, but never made it on the roster.  I'm excited to see him again, and young guys like him trying to make an impact.</p>
