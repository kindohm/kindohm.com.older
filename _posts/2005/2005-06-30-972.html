title: "Drawing more boundaries with Avalon"
---

<P>Last night I made more progress on <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/06/29/965.aspx">drawing Minnesota geography</A>.&nbsp; I spiffed up the UI a bit to allow the user to pick the cities they want to include and also added some zoom/panning controls.&nbsp; Right now everything is just with text boxes - ultimately I'd like to use sliders.&nbsp; Below is a screenshot with some of the metro cities along with some outstate cities:</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/AvalonState-AddCities.jpg" border=0></P> <P>Next I really want to start getting the zoom and panning functions to work. <A href="http://iwkid.blogspot.com" target=_blank>IW Kid</A> gave me a few suggestions about how to tackle it. His suggestion was to draw the graphics on a "canvas" and then use a "camera" to view the canvas at any point. Avalon DOES have a <A href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/winfx/ref/ns/system.windows.media.media3d/c/camera/camera.asp" target=_blank>Camera</A> class that is used in a <A href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/winfx/ref/ns/system.windows.controls/c/viewport3d/viewport3d.asp" target=_blank>ViewPort3D</A> object. So what does this mean? This means I have to go 3D.&nbsp; My app will need to go to &#8220;11&#8220;. Right now I'm just drawing everything as 2D.</P> <P>This idea is turning out to work pretty well so far. I haven't parsed and hooked up any of the <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/06/27/952.aspx">census data</A> yet, but I think that will be icing on the cake compared to drawing all of the city, state, and zip code boundaries on the screen. </P>
