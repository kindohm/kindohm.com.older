<P>If it doesn't snow today I'll be pissed.&nbsp; Never in my life have I seen so little snow as this winter.&nbsp; It's depressing.&nbsp; It's freaking January and I can still see my lawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the days when it'd be Thanksgiving weekend and there'd be snow up to your knees.&nbsp; I haven't even had to take my snow thrower out of the garage yet.&nbsp; I've only shoveled once this winter.&nbsp; If I sound a little too hung up on this, it's because I am.&nbsp; These are the truly important things in life.&nbsp; Snow.&nbsp; Music.&nbsp; Video games.&nbsp; Pet rocks.&nbsp; Spam sculptures.&nbsp; Filling up your tub with jello.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; Snow is right up there with those things.&nbsp; And yes, I have made a Spam sculpture and have pictures to prove it.</P>
