<p><strong>Researchers Find Average Desk Harbors 400 Times More Bacteria Than Average Toilet Seat </strong></p>

<p>I'm not suprised.&nbsp; How often do you clean your work area compared to your bathroom?&nbsp; I guess for some it might be about the same (for better or&nbsp;worse).&nbsp; But for me, I rarely clean&nbsp;the work surface in my cube&nbsp;- maybe once every 3 months or so.&nbsp; Just a simple cleaning spray and a paper towel can do the trick, and it's disgusting what you'll find that gets mopped up off of your work surface.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Perhaps one of the more eye-opening sentences in that article was this one:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The area where you rest your hand on your desk has &#8211; on average &#8211; 10 million bacteria&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We also have a foosball table in our office that gets used by many people throughout the day.&nbsp; I make a habit of washing my hands after every game I play on it...&nbsp; scary to think of how much bacteria is on those foosball table handles after a work day.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyway - I'm not paranoid about bacteria.&nbsp; The article was just interesting.&nbsp; We can't avoid germs all the time, and a person could obsess every second of the day about trying to keep clean.&nbsp; It's just not reasonable.&nbsp; Plus, the human body has an immune system that can defend against most of this stuff.&nbsp; But paying attention to keeping things clean from time to time and washing your hands can at least keep you from catching a cold, which to me is worthwhile.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#8220;Ok, thanks for the lecture dad.&nbsp; Can I get back to work now?&#8221;</p>
