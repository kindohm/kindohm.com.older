title: "Buying a league"

<p>This would be inredible, and bad.&nbsp; All 30 NHL teams all under the same ownership...&nbsp; I think it would possibly improve the NHL from a business perspective.&nbsp; But I don't like it for two reasons:</p>
<ol> 
<li>It's bad to put all your eggs in one basket.&nbsp; Geez, isn't there a better alternative phrase than that?&nbsp; Anyway, if the firm proposing to buy the teams folds, what happens to all the teams?&nbsp; Would the league need to round up 30 new suitors?&nbsp; Ick.</li> 
<li>This would hurt fans of teams that have good owners today.&nbsp; Take the MN Wild for example - they've bent over backwards to make the fans a part of the franchise as much as possible and have built a product tailored to Minnesota.&nbsp; I don't believe that those qualities would stay with new ownership.</li>
</ol> 
<p>I hope the NHL board of governers keep rejecting this proposal.&nbsp; The word is that the potential suitors will keep coming back with better offers.&nbsp; It's not worth it to me.&nbsp; The NHL is in bad shape, but not so bad that such a radical action needs to be taken.</p>
