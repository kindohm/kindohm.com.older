title: "The LAN party that was"

<P>The <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/09/20/1084.aspx">Halo 2 LAN party on Friday</A> was soo-per.&nbsp; A huge amount of thanks goes to <A href="http://www.jasonbock.net">Jason</A> for letting 13 invade his house and drink his beer.&nbsp; The cool part was that pretty much everyone there had played before and it got pretty competitive at times.&nbsp; The 14 of us were divided into two groups - one upstairs and one in the basement - and in general the teams followed that division.&nbsp; I think we probably could have mixed up the teams a bit during the night, but there were a lot of close games and a few epic battles.&nbsp; </P> <P>I hope to post pictures soon.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.softwarebuildersinc.com">John Schreifels</A> took a few shots on his camera, and so did I.&nbsp; I was planning on actually recording a lot of video footage, but I quickly realized that the video quality was very poor because the lighting was so dim.&nbsp; My camera just doesn't work well in low light at all.&nbsp; Maybe I'll just make a small slide show with a soundtrack or something...</P> <P>The only bummer is that there just wasn't enough time.&nbsp; For myself, life with a newborn requires me to get some amount of sleep, so I left around midnight.&nbsp; A lot of us have kids, and everyone actually decided to leave at midnight.&nbsp; But the big downside is that there was just so much more Halo 2 to play.&nbsp; I think <A href="http://www.bungie.net">Bungie</A> has done a fantastic job of providing all kinds of new maps for H2 (nine, I think), and there are just so many maps now to choose from.&nbsp; I don't think we played even half of them on Friday, let alone all of the possible game types.&nbsp; </P> <P>H2 has&nbsp;almost completely lost&nbsp;its ability to be fun over XBox live.&nbsp; LAN parties with people you know who are in earshot of smack-talk is much more fun :)&nbsp; If history repeats itself, we'll be playing again sometime in December or January.&nbsp; </P>
