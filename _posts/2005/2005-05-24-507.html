<P>Last night's <A href="http://www.medalistband.com" target=_blank>concert</A> went well.&nbsp; The small turnout was a bummer, but that seems to be the norm.&nbsp; Either we don't get the word out or music for winds and percussion is a dying art form in suburbia.&nbsp; </P> <P>Anyway, since <A href="http://www.leejsackett.com" target=_blank>Lee</A> (my friend and percussionist) and Shannon had their baby last Thursday, Lee couldn't make the concert.&nbsp; So, he had his sister Anna come and play as his replacement.&nbsp; Holy crap.&nbsp; I can't imagine coming fresh into a concert and sight-reading the entire show.&nbsp; Anna did an outstanding job - especially since she had never before&nbsp;played most of the music in the program.&nbsp; </P> <P>Now it's a few weeks off and then we start up rehearsals again for the summer.&nbsp; We'll be playing out at the Lake Harriet bandshell among other outdoor venues all summer, and they'll be FREE too, so if you're reading this you should check the <A href="http://www.medalistband.com/schedule/schedule.html" target=_blank>schedule</A> and come see us.&nbsp; </P>
