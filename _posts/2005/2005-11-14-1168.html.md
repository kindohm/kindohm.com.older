title: "I mixed my pants"
---

<p>This weekend in the wee hours of the morning on Sunday I took a few minutes to play with a Beat Slicer plugin for <a href="http://www.flstudio.com">FL Studio</a>.&nbsp; I took a drum beat from the good old&nbsp;<a href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Clips/Kindohm-Clips-FOOD.MP3">Food</a> track and the classic &#8220;I can't find my pants&#8221; line from the <a href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Clips/Kindohm-Clips-JOEY.MP3">Joey</a> track, completely cut and hacked them up, and created something new:</p>
<p><a href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Music%20Remnants/Kindohm-PantsMix.mp3">http://wss.kindohm.com/Music%20Remnants/Kindohm-PantsMix.mp3</a></p>
<p>The Pants Mix.&nbsp; Enjoy it, or fear it.&nbsp; Your choice.</p>
