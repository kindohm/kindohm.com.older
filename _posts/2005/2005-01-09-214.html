title: "Blog Spam"
---

Unfortunately, I'm falling victim to blog spam.&nbsp; Some of my posts are becoming infested with comments of no value other than to advertise someone else's site (e.g. online poker).&nbsp; I haven't been able to find any IP blocking or anti-spam features of my .Text blog, so if this gets any worse I'll have to disable comments until I find some better answers.&nbsp; In the meantime, if anyone has ideas about how to handle this, I'm all ears.&nbsp; Just don't advertise yer website with a block full of useless content in your comments, you sneaky geeks. :)
