title: "Top 5 Favorite US Cities"
---

<p>What are your top five favorite US cities?&nbsp; Here are mine in no particular order:</p>
<ol> 
<li>Minneapolis - it's a homer choice, but I really love it here.&nbsp; It's the laid back midwest feel with plenty of stuff to do.</li> 
<li>Seattle - it's like a big city in northern Minnesota, except there's mountains.&nbsp; </li> 
<li>San Francisco - just like <a href="http://www.visitduluth.com/">my home town</a>, except the hills aren't as steep :)&nbsp; </li> 
<li>Santa Cruz - not a big city, but they have a beach and a boardwalk with a roller coaster.&nbsp; Lots of camping nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pine trees and mountains (do you see a theme?)</li> 
<li>Chicago - big city close to home.&nbsp; It's just a lot of fun to visit.&nbsp; Lots of food and places to go.</li>
</ol> 
<p>Runners up:</p>
<ol> 
<li>New York</li> 
<li>Boston</li> 
<li>Denver</li> 
<li>Washington D.C.</li>
</ol>
