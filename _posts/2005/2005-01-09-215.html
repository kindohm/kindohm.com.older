<P>So far I have about 75% of the core domain objects done, and I've completed the simulation engine (in 3 hours total) this morning.  The front end for domain administration is complete.  Here's the bulk of what's left:</P> <UL> <LI>Address some database connection pooling issues (connections aren't closing)</LI> <LI>Shorten simulation times</LI> <LI>Connect the simulation engine to the domain objects so that simulated data can be saved</LI> <LI>Complete the user interface for users to browse teams, players, games, and stats</LI> <LI>Add content administration features (team articles, player bios, opinions, etc)</LI> <LI>Add general commenting features</LI> <LI>Add bug reporting/feature request forms</LI> <LI>Develop controls and content for home page</LI></UL> <P>The biggest issue to address right now is the long simulation times.  It takes about 45 seconds to simulate one game, which is acceptable but I'd like it to be better.  The simulation will be executed from a Windows desktop app on my own, so if I can't get it going much faster then I can live with it.  </P>
