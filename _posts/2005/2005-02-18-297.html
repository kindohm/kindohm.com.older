title: "I Shaved My Head"
---

<P>That's right.&nbsp; I shaved my head this morning.&nbsp; Thanks to <A href="http://www.jasonbock.net/" target=_blank>Jason</A> for some advice on how to go about doing it.&nbsp; The weirdest part about it isn't the look, but how it feels.&nbsp; It's like my head has been numb because it's had hair to buffer it from any sense of touch or something.&nbsp; I couldn't feel the water on my head in the shower.&nbsp; </P> <P>But anyway...&nbsp; here's some proof:</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/shavecrop.jpg"></P> <P>But why stop there? Since I was on a roll with a cosmetic transformation, I thought I'd keep going:</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/shavecrop-punch.jpg"></P> <P>Whoa! A little too much. So I backed it off a bit:</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/shavecrop-pinch.jpg"></P> <P>So if I look a little funny the next time you see me, this should explain it.</P>
