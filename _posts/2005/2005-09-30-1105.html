title: "Basement contractors"

<P>I'm kinda giving up on my own craftsmanship.&nbsp; I'm having a contractor come to the house tomorrow to do an estimate for the remainder of the framing and all of the drywall work for the basement.&nbsp; Not all of the contractors I've called do both framing <STRONG>and</STRONG> drywall, but this guy does, and I'm kind of excited to get the estimate done.&nbsp; First, it's been ages since I've done any work down there and it'd be nice to pick up the pace and keep the project going.&nbsp; Second, I'm really curious to see how much it might cost.</P> <P>I still have to get the electrical work done though.&nbsp; I'd contract that out too, but there's really no point.&nbsp; All of the boxes are up and the wires have been run.&nbsp; I just have to unhook all of the fixtures that I wasn't supposed to before the first inspection :)&nbsp; Oh, if you work for the State of Minnesota, just ignore that last sentence.</P>
