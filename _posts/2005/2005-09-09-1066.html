<P><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/POLLSERVER/results/19981.content.html">Should a "hurricane czar" be named to take over the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort?</a></P> <p>Hell no.  There's already enough leadership in place that should have stepped up already to lead the recovery.  Appointing someone new will only stir up more controversey and media fodder.  It will only solidify the fact that the existing leadership wasn't competent to get the job done.  </p> <p>If a "Czar" were to be appointed, it would make the USA look a little weaker.  Damnit, can't somebody roll up their sleeves and take charge?  Are the leaders too concerned about failing or being able to please everybody to take charge?  Are they afraid of taking blame and making mistakes?  The approach of staying an arm's length away from the issues and not dealing with them directly seems to be more commonplace among public officials these days.</p>
