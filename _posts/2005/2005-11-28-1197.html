title: "Who has the control in Agile Development?"
---

<P>I recently heard&nbsp;another developer&nbsp;say that &#8220;management doesn't like agile development because it gives too much control and freedom to the developers&#8221;.&nbsp; I really don't know if that statement was actually&nbsp;spoken by someone, but I couldn't get that line out of my head because it bugged me so much.&nbsp; To me, it sounded like something that would come from someone that has pushed aside agile development without trying to understand it.&nbsp; </P> <P>There is more than one agile development methodology out there, but most of my experience comes from <A href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</A>.&nbsp; Personally I don't buy in to all aspects of XP, but I think its general approach and process makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; In XP, the developer is responsible for writing code and performing estimates.&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp; The customer decides what features get put into each iteration.&nbsp; As problems come up, the customer determines if priorities should be changed and what features should be deferred to future iterations.&nbsp; The customer decides what features are most important so that those features get worked on first throughout the entire project.&nbsp; </P> <P>Exactly how does this give the developer too much control and freedom?&nbsp; The customer steers the project the entire time.&nbsp; </P> <P>I <STRONG>have</STRONG> seen specific&nbsp;instances of agile development practiced where the technical staff (developers, project managers) doesn't communicate with the customer and they run the project on their own.&nbsp; As communication is key to agile development, this really isn't agile development at all, and should really just be called a disaster.&nbsp; Perhaps managers who think that agile development gives too much control to developers have not seen it done correctly.&nbsp; </P>
