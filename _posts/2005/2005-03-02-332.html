title: "Hardware dissonance"
---

<P>This is driving me nuts.&nbsp; I'm contracting out at *confidential client name* right now and am working amongst a plethora of servers and other types of hardware.&nbsp; There is an abundance of noise in this room, but the main server rack has a device in it that is whining at a constant pitch.&nbsp; </P> <P>The noise itself ain't so bad.&nbsp; What's killing me is that the constant pitch of the device&nbsp;is near to the pitch of some sustained notes in the 2nd movement of Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto (which I am listening to).&nbsp; When I say &#8220;near&#8221;, I mean the two pitches are severely out of tune together and it makes my skin crawl each time it happens.&nbsp; </P> <P>But thankfully, the 3rd movement now begins.&nbsp; I must go.</P>
