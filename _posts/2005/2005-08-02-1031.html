<P>Tonight we went to the MN Wild select-a-seat in an attempt to find some nicer seats to upgrade to (not that ours are bad at all), but we didn't find anything better.&nbsp; There were two open seats one row down from us, but we liked the angle of our seats better.&nbsp; Ours are just behind one of the goal lines on the side of the arena and it's a great vantage point to see plays develop and goals scored.</P> <P>I brought along our camera just for fun, and got a few good pictures.&nbsp; All of the pictures can be viewed in the <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/41.aspx">2005 select-a-seat gallery</A>, but some highlights are below.</P> <P>Perhaps two of the most interesting sights there were of the modifications they've made to the arena for the new rules this season.&nbsp; The goals have been moved back toward the boards, and some red lines have been added to define a zone behind the goals where goalies are limited to play the puck:</P> <P><A href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/41/787.aspx" target=_blank><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/photos/41/787.aspx" width=350 border=0></A><BR><EM>Fresh concrete footings for the new goal mooring positions.</EM></P> <P><A href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/41/797.aspx" target=_blank><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/photos/41/797.aspx" width=350 border=0></A><BR><EM>New zone lines behind the goal.</EM></P> <P>Other than that, the rest are just kinda fun:</P> <P><A href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/41/763.aspx" target=_blank><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/photos/41/763.aspx" width=350 border=0></A><BR><EM>View from our seats.</EM></P> <P><A href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/41/777.aspx" target=_blank><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/photos/41/777.aspx" width=350 border=0></A><BR><EM>Wild locker room.</EM></P> <P><A href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/41/789.aspx" target=_blank><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/photos/41/789.aspx" width=350 border=0></A><BR><EM>Mike by the goal.</EM></P>
