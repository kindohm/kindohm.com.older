title: "2004-2005 NHL Season Cancelled"

<P>It's official: <A href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=115107&amp;hubName=nhl">link</A> [<A href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=115107&amp;hubName=nhl" target=_blank>^</A>].</P> <P>While this is unfortunate, scrapping this season was probably the best thing to do anyway.&nbsp; An abbreviated season this year wouldn't have been worth it.&nbsp; </P> <P>What I'm glad to see is that the League wasn't bluffing and that they held their ground - unlike the NHLPA - over the past 6 months.&nbsp; I happen to agree with the League that a cap is needed, and they stuck to their guns to make sure they get their way.&nbsp; The players have lost this battle because their livelyhood and income was on the line.&nbsp; They gambled and didn't get their way.&nbsp; </P> <P>So many of the NHL'ers are now&nbsp;playing in minor leagues or European leagues.&nbsp; They don't want a salary cap and want to let the market determine their value, yet they're now playing in leagues that HAVE a cap and where their market value is low.&nbsp; How hyprocrytical is that?</P> <P>Now that there isn't any urgency, I fear that talks between the League and NHLPA will not resume until it's time for the next season to actually start.&nbsp; Far to late to start talking in my opinion.&nbsp; Unless the players have a change in heart, or the rank-and-file union members drum up enough support to convince their leaders to accept the League's cap number so they can make a living, I believe the lockout will continue deep into next season.&nbsp; </P> <P>Well, at least I won't have to&nbsp;feel bad&nbsp;about sitting on the couch watching the Stanley Cup Playoffs on a beautiful, warm&nbsp;June evening&nbsp;this year.</P>
