<P>Ok, I <I>promise</I> I'll post an update from the vacation sometime soon... not likely it'll be today though. Today is my first day back at work, engaging in post-vacation damage and shock control along with typical back-to-work activities like reading dozens of unread emails, RSS posts, and responding to various questions directed towards me while I was gone. </P> <P>Coming back to work is a mental exercise for me. My mind is elsewhere... wishing it were relaxing and having fun like the last 10 days. </P>
