title: "Going on vacation"

<p>Nikki and I want to take one last big trip before we have the baby, so we decided to go to Antarctica in April.&nbsp; We're leaving April 3rd and will be back on April 10th.&nbsp; We're pretty excited about it and neither of us have been there before, so we're really looking forward to it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We'll be bringing the camera and camcorder along, so I'll plan on having a nice documentary of the trip sometime after we get back.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If anyone has been there before, we're interested in learning about the &#8220;hot spots&#8221; and interesting places to go, so feel free to leave some suggestions.</p>
