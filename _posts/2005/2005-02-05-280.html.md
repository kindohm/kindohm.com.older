<p>Yo.&nbsp; I made some minor changes to the kindohm.com stylesheet, so the dozen or so people (read: <strong><em>you</em></strong>) who actually come to kindohm.com may not see the changes unless&nbsp;you click your &#8220;refresh&#8221; button while viewing the site.&nbsp; The changes aren't very major, but make the site a bit more aesthetically pleasing - also known as "fly" (&#169; Mike Doughty).</p>
