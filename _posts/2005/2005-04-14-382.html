<P>I'll post an update yet.&nbsp; Work has gotten pretty busy since I got back and my nights have been keeping me occupied with <A href="http://www.medalistband.com">Medalist</A>&nbsp;rehearsals and concerts, some yard work, and another website redesign (inspired by an image taken on vacation).&nbsp; </P> <P><A href="http://http://www.kindohm.com/LanPartyDetail.aspx?PartyID=SomeUniqueID">Friday is the next Halo 2 LAN Party</A>, so if I don't get it done tonight it won't be until Saturday.&nbsp; Ok then.</P>
