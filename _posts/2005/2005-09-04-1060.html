<P>Yesterday we were watching TV and channel flopping between two channels that were showing shows that were absolute polar opposites:&nbsp; <EM>What Not To Wear</EM> and <EM>Fight Club</EM>.&nbsp; Talk about two total contradictory themes.&nbsp; Anyway, we ended up sticking with <EM>Fight Club</EM>.&nbsp; Whew.</P>
