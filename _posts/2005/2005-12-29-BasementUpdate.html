<P>I talked to the state electrical inspector yesterday about how far I need to go with unhooking all of my electrical work for the first inspection, and he said that I can keep the recessed lights hooked up and turned on.  Evidently that's allowed because the recessed light fixtures have hard-wired connections in their box that were made by the manufacturer.  What they want to see unhooked are the non-recessed fixtures where you're actually hooking wires to the fixture (as opposed to recessed lights where it's wire-to-wire, not wire-to-fixture).  </P> <P>So what does this mean?  This means that I don't have to spend a whole day un-wiring recessed lights.  Those damn recessed lights were the harded part of the electrical work because it's tough to maneuver between the floor joists.  Working above your head on a ladder isn't very fun either.  After a little bit of work on the circuit breaker, I can have the rough-in inspection done and start drywall finally.  </P> <P>This project has been going on for almost two years.  It's time to get it done, dammit.  Having a new daughter makes it tough to find time, but that's no excuse for not making time.  Nikki and I are very, very, VERY eager to use the new space.  And <A href="http://www.jasonbock.net">Jason</A> and I are eager to use it for <A href="http://www.sidetrackedproject.net">The Sidetracked Project</A>.  </P>
