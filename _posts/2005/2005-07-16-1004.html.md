title: "I broke my Swish"
---

<p>Yesterday I broke one of my favorite cymbals that I own - my 18" Zildjian Swish. They don't make them anymore either:</p>

I was playing yesterday and suddenly noticed that it sounded really funny, then looked up and saw the damage.</p>
<p>I really liked the cymbal because it was a good cross between a typical crash cymbal and a china. It has more sustain than a china, and I played it like a crash. I'm not sure if I want to look for a new cymbal or not. It seems to sound ok for now, and I'd rather not spend the money. I suspect that the cracks that extend out of the damaged area will only get worse though.</p>
