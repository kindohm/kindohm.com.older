<P><IMG height=300 src="http://www.bungie.net/images/news/inlineimages/relic.gif" width=400 align=right>I'm not into Halo 2 as much as I used to be, but I've had my eye on the new <A href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=relic&amp;p=3762564">Relic map</A> since I heard about it and saw glimpses of it.&nbsp; There's a <A href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=relic&amp;p=3762564">new article</A> on it over at Bungie.net that describes it in detail.&nbsp; Like Zanzibar, Relic looks and feels like no other map.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;that's because of its asymmetry and its &#8220;natural&#8221; appearance and environment.&nbsp; Teams will have to put a lot of brain power into CTF and assault, and the map has&nbsp;many unique features that will keep things interesting.&nbsp; The article does a good job of explaining the map along with some strategic details.</P> <P>There's also a <A href="http://files3.bungie.org/Relic_640x480.wmv">video</A> that highlights some gameplay and a few of the neat features of the map (available on a halo.bungie.org video page: <A href="http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/maptacularvids.html">http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/maptacularvids.html</A>).&nbsp; The video page also has videos of some of the other newer maps.&nbsp; </P> <P>While I'm eager to see and play the new map, I'm skeptical I'll actually enjoy it as much as I hope.&nbsp; I just don't meet up with friends online or in person to play Halo 2 as much as I used to.&nbsp; </P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
