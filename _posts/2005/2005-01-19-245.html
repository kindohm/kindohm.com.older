<P>There is a deal to be made.&nbsp; I'm optimistic:</P> <P><A href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=111787&amp;hubName=nhl">Link</A></P> <P>In my opinion this is the best negotiating that has&nbsp;happened since the lockout begin in September.&nbsp; Bettman and Goodenow had to be removed from the process to make this happen.&nbsp; With those two out I think something will happen tomorrow.&nbsp; </P>
