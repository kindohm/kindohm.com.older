title: "Fact of the Meter"
---

<p>Remember back in high school (or college) when you were learning about units of measure and how the length of a Meter was defined by a metal rod stored in a safe guarded by <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/09/15/1079.aspx">rugged soldiers</a> somewhere in Europe?&nbsp; Well not any more.&nbsp; I was suprised to learn that the length of a Meter is now defined by the distance that light travels in one second.</p>
<p>I found this out after hearing on NPR that the Nobel prize for physics was awarded today for three scientists' work with optics and quantum mechanics.&nbsp; The reporter mentioned that the speed of light can be measured so accurately that the length of the Meter can be most accurately defined using the speed of light.&nbsp; This is now the way the Meter is defined in the science community.</p>
<p>Maybe this is old news, but I never heard about it until today.&nbsp; Very cool.</p>
