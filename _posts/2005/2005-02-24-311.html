Man it's been a long time since I've listened to this one. I had it dubbed off of a cassette in high school and listened to it over and over and over back then. I'd forgotten how great it was...</P> <P>You just don't hear stuff like this any more. I'm not talking about the "metal" genre. I'm talking about the creativity. This CD is continuously interesting. There's always something happening in the music either at a small (e.g. a quick fill, break, or time change) or large (e.g. melodies, themes) level. Most of the stuff out there today is so one-dimensional. It's more about your attitude than what you compose. </P> <P>I'm not bashing new music. I love a lot of the newer music I'm targeting with these comments. It's just that it's rare to see a lot of creativity today.</P>
