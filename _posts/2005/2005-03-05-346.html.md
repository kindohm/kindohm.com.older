<p>I picked up a few CD's last night. I highly recommend both:</p>

<td style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt" valign="top"><strong>Hatebreed - <em>The Rise of 
	Brutality</em></strong>. This one's been on my list for a long time. An 
	improvement of their prior release, <em>Perseverence</em>. The production 
	is better and it's heavier. The guitar riffs were constructed for pure heaviness 
	and power. Not as much shred-tempo tunes on this one, which I am glad about. Only
	 downside is that I'd like to see a little more variation in the how the tunes 
	 sound. </td></tr></tbody></table>

	 	<strong>Low- <em>The Great Destroyer</em></strong>. Low is from 
	 	my hometown and I'm glad to see that they're still going strong. 
	 	This disc is a huge change in their sound - they've always been 
	 	known for their minimalist/slow-core sound, but this is nothing 
	 	like their old stuff. Alan and Mimi's vocals sound stronger than 
	 	ever, and I absolutely love the smooth and warm but heavily 
	 	distorted guitars. The production is excellent and the mixing 
	 	is creative. Go take a listen on Amazon. </td></tr></tbody></table>
