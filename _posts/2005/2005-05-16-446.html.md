<p>Lately, life has been a bit of a blur and there hasn't been any time for sitting and relaxing.&nbsp; Non-stop working on the basement, urgent software fixes, buying baby furniture, yardwork, rehersals and concerts, etc, etc, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By the way, come see the <a href="http://www.medalistband.org/">Bloomington Medalist Concert Band</a> on Monday May 23rd, 7:30, at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1800+West+Old+Shakopee+Road,++Bloomington+MN+55431-3027&amp;spn=0.041931,0.073167&amp;hl=en">Bloomington Fine Arts Center</a>.&nbsp; I don't know how much tickets will be, but if you get them in advance they're cheaper.&nbsp; I think they might be like $10, which is kind of high to me, but it'll be a good show.&nbsp; We're playing some good stuff.</p>
<p>I'm tired of people complaining about the weather.&nbsp; It's Minnesota, and it's only May.&nbsp; Besides, you can't do anything about it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nikki and I watched &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/">I &hearts; Huckabees</a>" on Saturday night.&nbsp; An excellent movie.&nbsp; If you like mainstream stuff, then don't watch it, but you can't go wrong with Dustin Hoffman.&nbsp; Mark Wahlberg was hilarious.</p>
