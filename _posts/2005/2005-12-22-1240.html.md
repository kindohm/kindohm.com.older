title: "Pervasive SDK Documentation"
---

<p>My joy at finding a .Net Pervasive data provider is being crushed.&nbsp; Their SDK is terrible - it's a PDF document.&nbsp; It's not like they've written documentation that is presented better in PDF format either (instead of a HTML/chm format).&nbsp; They're providing summaries of classes, code examples, and so on.&nbsp; So why not just use a nice little tool called NDoc?&nbsp; Maybe they had a good business reason to use PDF, but they're just pissing me off in the process.</p>
<p>But what's really bothering me is that an entire namespace in the SDK is not documented (Pervasive.Data.SqlClient.Lna).&nbsp; An exception of the type Pervasive.Data.SqlClient.Lna.LnaException is being thrown in my code, but the SDK doesn't have any information about it.&nbsp; Googling on the class name and the full type name haven't turned up anything.&nbsp; </p>
