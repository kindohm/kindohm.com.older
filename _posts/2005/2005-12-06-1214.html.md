title: "Hating SQL Server - put into practice"
---

<p>Last week, <a href="http://twopenguins.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">John</a> at work passed around <a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/archive/2005/05/24/5248.aspx" target="_blank">a post about how much SQL Server sucks</a> (read the article for the sarcasm).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Well, today I found that the article speaks a lot of truth and SQL Server really does suck.&nbsp; I mean, why can't SQL Server figure out what to do with data in a column like this:</p>

<pre><code>5, 9, 11, 17,</code></pre>
<p>Yes, that's an example from a real table in an upgrade project I'm working on.&nbsp; Yes, that data exists within a single row in a single column. Yes, those are real values that relate to&nbsp;primary keys in some other table. </p>

<p>Why use a relational database if you're just going to muck it up like this? A database should be cared for, hugged, petted, and treated with the respect that it deserves. Not poked with a stick and taunted with "Dr. E.F. Codd is tied up and locked in my basement, now what are you going to do about it!!??".</p>
