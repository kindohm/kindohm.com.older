<P>I bought some new drum mics last week.&nbsp; It's a <A href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/srs7/g=home/search/detail/base_pid/270749/">7-piece set</A> made by CAD.&nbsp; They'd low-end as far as audio quality goes, but they have built-in drum clips which is one of the main featres I was looking for.&nbsp; I tried them out last night by recording an older song of mine and was very happy with how they worked.&nbsp; I was a bit concerned about mic bleed and strange tones with the mics - as those are common problems that cheap mics have - but I was very pleased with them.&nbsp; I'm mainly using them just to mic my toms, and toms aren't used very often, so that's probably one reason why they sounded ok.&nbsp; If I wanted to use the mics for the snare, bass, or overheads, they'd probably sound terrible.</P> <P>So now I have 4 other mics that came with the set that I'm not using.&nbsp; It's not that I don't want to use them, but now I don't have enough mixer space to plug them all in at the same time!&nbsp; That's ok though, because my kit is now being thoroughly mic'ed with&nbsp;just the 3 new tom mics.&nbsp; Knowing me I'll find something else I'd like to do with them though.&nbsp; Then I'll be in the market for a bigger ($$$) mixer.&nbsp; </P> <P>In order to try out my new mics I had to bring out my drums and set them up.&nbsp; I've been keeping them in storage so that I can keep working on the basement.&nbsp; It's so tempting to just leave them out and keep trying stuff, but I HAVE to tear them down and put them back if I'm going to keep making any basement progress.&nbsp; </P>
