<P>If you're into the Drum n Bass musical genre, then check out <A href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/rakoonmusic.htm">RAkoon</A> [<A href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/rakoonmusic.htm" target=_blank>^</A>].&nbsp; Some of the darkest and most creative DnB I've heard in a while.&nbsp; Check out Therak and&nbsp;EVOL for a start.&nbsp; He uses some Star Wars (&#8221;He's more machine now than man&#8221;) and Lord of the Rings (&#8221;You shall not pass!!&#8221;) samples in a few tracks...&nbsp; A lot of producers try and force movie samples like those into tracks and it sounds cheesey, but I think this guy does it creatively while making them fit in with the rest of the music.&nbsp; </P> <P>Enjoy.</P>
