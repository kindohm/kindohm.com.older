<p>Nikki and I are now parents!&nbsp; We have a new daughter named Eva Joy Hodnick.&nbsp; She was born 8/18/2005 at 11:09 AM.&nbsp; She was 7 pounds 11 ounces and was 20.5 inches long.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After a brisk walk the night before, Nikki started having much more frequent and intense contractions.&nbsp; We went into the hospital at about 4:30 A.M. and she was dialated 4cm.&nbsp; The labor went very, very well and it was pretty much a textbook delivery.&nbsp; The birth was 100% natural (Nikki didn't use any drugs at all), and I don't know how she was able to do it!&nbsp; We were open to the option of using some drugs but the labor was going well enough that we decided not to.&nbsp; She went through a lot of pain, but it was worth it!</p>
