title: "Studying the Math of Meshuggah"
---

<P>Jason and I had an interesting little chat today:</P> <PRE><CODE>Jason Bock says:
I'm going to do a mathematic's Master's thesis on Meshuggah's 
time signatures

Mike Hodnick says:
"Explain how Meshuggah's time signatures support the 
theory that imaginary numbers are strongly tied to human 
emotions such as aggression and anger"

Mike Hodnick says:
Use a differential equation to solve for the rate of 
change of the number of accented beats per measure on 
track 2 of Meshuggah's "Nothing" album

Jason Bock says:
LOL

Mike Hodnick says:
Using linear regression, determine whether a time signature 
of 5/16 versus 11/8 causes a significant change in the 
number of dotted-sixteenth notes played per measure on 
a Meshuggah CD

Jason Bock says:
Or a rip in the fabric of spacetime

Mike Hodnick says:
hehe

Mike Hodnick says:
Does the BPM of a Meshuggah CD significantly decrease as 
you approach the speed of light?

Mike Hodnick says:
or does the song become infinitely heavy

Mike Hodnick says:
ha!

Jason Bock says:
you're on a roll today</CODE></PRE>
