title: "Come on weather people...everybody say snow..."
---

<P>Year to year, it baffles me how seriously people take weather forecasters and weather forecasting.&nbsp; This past weekend, friends and family of mine made some intense statements about how lousy weather forecasters are on the news channels.&nbsp; And maybe what's even worse, comments were made about how weather forecasters &#8220;hedge&#8221; their forecasts by saying things such as &#8220;it may snow&#8221; or &#8220;snow is probable&#8221; instead of saying it <EM>will</EM> snow.&nbsp; </P> <P>Well no kidding.&nbsp; You don't say.&nbsp; Hmmm,&nbsp;maybe they hedge their forecasts because they <EM>actually cannot predict the future</EM>.&nbsp; They need to hedge their statements because some overreactive viewers will get pissed if they are wrong.&nbsp; Weather forecasting has got to be an extremely difficult task.&nbsp; Hell, it might even be more difficult than estimating software development.&nbsp; </P> <P>Forecasts are to be taken with a grain of salt.&nbsp; So the next time you hear someone complain about the accuracy of a forecast, ask them to <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/11/09/1166.aspx">wash their hands</A> and give them a kick in the shin.&nbsp; </P>
