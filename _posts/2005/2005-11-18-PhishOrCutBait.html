<P>I recently received an email at my personal email address on my kindohm.com domain:</P><PRE><CODE>
Dear Kindohm Member,

Your e-mail account was used to send a huge amount of unsolicited 
spam messages during the recent week. If you could please take 5-10 
minutes out of your online experience and confirm the attached 
document so you will not run into any future problems with the 
online service.

If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice 
but to cancel your membership.

Virtually yours,
The Kindohm Support Team 
</CODE></PRE>
<P>I love this stuff. I suddenly have my own support team? Wow! However, I guess I'm a little concerned that my membership to <STRONG><EM>my own domain</EM></STRONG> that <STRONG><EM>I own</EM></STRONG> might be cancelled. Maybe I should fire somebody. I feel like a dotcom executive or something.</P> <P>Anyway, this message came attached with a "zip" file. Who knows what was in it. The message now has a happy little home in my deleted items folder, which will be emptied promptly.</P>
