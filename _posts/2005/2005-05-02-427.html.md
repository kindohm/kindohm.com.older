title: "The Weekend"
---

<p>Nikki and I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373926/" target="_blank">The Interpreter</a> on Saturday.&nbsp; It's a fantastic movie.&nbsp; Nikki and I have really been disappointed with so many movies we've seen recently, and it was&nbsp;great to actually see a good one.&nbsp; The story, acting, and setting are all excellent.&nbsp; The story is set much within the United Nations, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie set in there before.&nbsp; It's just very cool and I definately recommend it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I also got quite a bit of work done on the basement this weekend.&nbsp; Nikki's stepdad came over on Saturday and we finished all of the framing that encloses the ductwork in the ceiling.&nbsp; Now I need to wire up some smoke detectors, move some heat vents, put up the remaining light fixture boxes, finish the wiring, then put in all the insulation.&nbsp; After that we'll have the first inspection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009V7T2/qid=1115045695/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/104-4488091-6156716?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846" target="_blank">The Mars Volta CD</a> came in the mail last week, and I got a chance to listen to it.&nbsp; Some good stuff.&nbsp; While listening I thought, &#8220;gee this sounds a lot like System of a Down's first CD in how it was produced.&nbsp; I wonder if it was produced by Rick Rubin&#8221;.&nbsp; And sure enough, it is.&nbsp; Rick Rubin is a master.&nbsp; Anyway, I then was looking at tour dates and found that The Mars Volta is actually touring <strong>with</strong> System of a Down.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I also spent some time playing <a href="http://www.fireflyworlds.com/sh2_index.php" target="_blank">Stronghold 2</a> this weekend.&nbsp; I've never been much of a real-time-strategy gamer, and it shows :)&nbsp; I played online with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whoisjake.com">Jake</a> once and learned some basics, then played against the computer a few times on Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; I'm getting better, but it's a genre that I'm just not used to playing.&nbsp; However, it's definately a blast to play.</p>
