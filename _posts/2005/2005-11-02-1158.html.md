title: "On the glass at an NHL game"

<p>Last Saturday Nikki and I sat in the fourth row on the lower level at the <a href="http://www.wild.com/games/?game_id=19">Columbus vs. Wild game</a>.&nbsp; Every year we treat ourselves and try and get some <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: line-through">pretty-people</span> up-close seats.&nbsp; It was fun, but I wouldn't like to sit in those seats more than once a year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The good thing about those seats is that you get to see the players up close.&nbsp; First, you get a feel for how athletic they are and how fast and hard they play.&nbsp; When they skate, it's always a full-out sprint.&nbsp; From up in our regular seats, it just looks like they're skating along without too much effort.&nbsp; Seeing the expressions on players faces is fun too.&nbsp; Watching <a href="http://www.wild.com/team/player.asp?player_id=26">Zyuzin</a> stick out his tongue while winding up for a slapshot, and watching <a href="http://www.wild.com/team/player.asp?player_id=23">Walz</a> with his endless supply of&nbsp;facial contortions while skating...&nbsp; you don't see those things from the 200 level.&nbsp; You also get a better idea of how fast and hard the hits are against the boards.&nbsp; The face-plants up against the glass are always great.</p>
<p>But what's bad about the fourth row is that you can't see the entire game and you can't see plays develop.&nbsp; There were four goals scored in the game, and we didn't really see any of them happen because of our vantage point.&nbsp; Being up on the 200 level gives a much better perspective on what's going on and you can see the goals scored on both ends of the ice.&nbsp; Down low, you can't really see what's going on other than the physical play of some individual players.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I guess it's all about what you like.&nbsp; Some people would rather see the up close action and not care about watching how well the team is playing overall.&nbsp; In a few weeks we have another game to go to, and I'm eager to get back up to good old section 216.&nbsp; </p>
