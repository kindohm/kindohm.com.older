title: "Progress with 3D"
---

<P>I just wanted to post some screenies of some progress I've made on rendering and viewing geometries in 3D in Avalon. Eventually I will provide some code and write about what I learned about 3D meshes and triangle vertices, but for now it's just some screen shots.</P> <P>I basically experimented with drawing a polygon on a plane. I started with a simple octagon, but then decided to stretch out some of its vertices to see if I could render something more "unique" (e.g. like a <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/06/27/952.aspx">state or city boundary</A>). This first shot is an overhead view looking down on the polygon. You can see the X and Z axis alongside it:</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/overhead.gif"></P> <P>Avalon provdes the ability to draw 3D geometries within a <A href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/winfx/ref/ns/system.windows.controls/c/viewport3d/viewport3d.asp">Viewport3D</A> object. You can then view the geometries within the Viewport3D with a <A href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/winfx/ref/ns/system.windows.media.media3d/c/camera/camera.asp">Camera</A>. The next shot is the same polygon in the same position but with the camera moved into the positive X, Y, and Z space:</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/posxposz.gif"></P> <P>And another image in the negative X, positive Z, and positive Y space:</P> <P><IMG src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/negxposz.gif"></P> <P>Getting this basic exercise to work was very, very simple but only after I understood what a triangle mesh is.</P>
