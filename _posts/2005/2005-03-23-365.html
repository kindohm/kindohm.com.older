title: "What&#39;s in my car stereo?"
---

<P>It's a new category.&nbsp; A snapshot of the revolving selection of music in the listening lab that is my car.</P> <UL> <LI>Dillenger Escape Plan : <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00029J24Y/qid=1111585456/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-6547042-5635960" target=_blank>Miss Machine</A>. Just picked this up a few days ago. Simply put, they're hardcore progressive rock, with emphasis on the hardcore and the progressive - take those two words to the extreme and you have DEP. </LI> <LI>Primus : <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001Y47/qid=1111586217/sr=2-5/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_5/104-6547042-5635960" target=_blank>The Brown Album</A>. The first CD after drummer Tim "Herb" Alexander quit the band. The Primus sound, but recorded raw and dirty.</LI> <LI>Hatebreed : <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DJYNS/qid=1111586402/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-6547042-5635960" target=_blank>The Rise of Brutality</A>. I blogged on this one earlier. Good 'ol, well-produced hardcore.</LI> <LI>Metallica : <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002H2H/qid=1111586466/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-6547042-5635960" target=_blank>Ride the Lightning</A>. Wanted to start listening to this again after a long time. </LI> <LI>Sepultura : <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000H4V/qid=1111586576/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/104-6547042-5635960" target=_blank>Chaos A.D.</A>. In my opinion, this album is the root of frontman Max Cavalera's ideas for his Soulfly project. </LI> <LI><A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00067RF6E/qid%3D1111586707/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/104-6547042-5635960" target=_blank>Halo 2 Soundtrack</A>. The soundtrack music is OK, but the new Incubus tracks are excellent. </LI> <LI>Incubus : <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00018D5CQ/qid=1111586778/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-6547042-5635960" target=_blank>A Crow Left of the Murder</A>. The latest Incubus studio album. They're still maintaining their direction in the world of pop rock but are starting to blend more of their original, more creative songwriting into the mix.</LI></UL>
