title: "Better than Relic?"
---

<P>I just checked out the <A href="http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/archive/episode.php?id=149" target=_blank>video walkthrough</A> of the new Halo 2 map named <A href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=terminal" target=_blank>Terminal</A>. Based on Bungie's article, I didn't think it'd be a very large or complex map. After watching the video, it's definately a lot bigger, more intricate and interesting than I had pictured. </P> <P>The train that flies by every so often was really cool to see. I'm curious to see how it affects gameplay...</P> <P>Like Zanzibar and <A href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=relic" target=_blank>Relic</A>, Terminal is a good single-flag CTF gametype map where the offense needs to fight their way through the map to get to the defense's base. But what I liked the best was that the defense gets a very high position at their base with battle rifles. Their position overlooks an open stretch of the map that the offense must pass through to get the flag. The offense has a sniper rifle availble to them to help pick off defenders on top - but it's across an open stretch so it'll be a risk to go get it. Very cool.</P> <P>I've been playing H2 more frequently lately. Lots of team slayer. I'm looking forward to playing single-flag CTF on the new maps... at our last LAN party we barely played any CTF at all. </P>
