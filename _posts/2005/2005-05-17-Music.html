<P>I've been songwriting and recording since the year 2000, and this is what I have to show for it. Here's a list of albums and compilations. To download mp3's and see more detail, just click on an album.</P> <p><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/12/08/Studio.aspx">Click here for information about Mike's studio</a></p> <UL> <li><a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2006/03/03/Electronica.aspx">Electronica</a> - (2005-present) Electronic compositions of the DnB/IDM flavor.</li> <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/CalleFabioRufino.aspx">Calle Fabio Rufino</A> - (2004) The latest and greatest. Recorded while working on the soundproof room in the basement. This recording features the POD guitar simulation module for the first time. Mixed/mastered using Sonar 1.1.  <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/FuryStopper.aspx">Fury Stopper</A> - (2004) Recorded in the raw confines of the basement of my house in Chaska. The drums were completely surrounded by concrete walls when they were recorded, and it actually doesn't sound that bad! I utilized the bedroom closet for guitar/vocal tracks. Completely produced using the Yamaha AW16G.  <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/Basic.aspx">Basic</A> - (2003) Straight up rock. These tracks are from a mix of different recording locations, sessions, and instruments. Some of it was done in Crystal, and some in Chaska. Get your head nod on.  <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/Sonar.aspx">Sonar</A> - (2002) Recorded at the old house in Crystal. These tunes sound pretty good considering the tools I was using at the time. Drums were only on one track, and no guitar amps were ever used. Definately some of the more creative songs on this one.  <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/OS.aspx">OS</A> - (2002) The 2nd Kindohm CD, recorded at the Crystal house. This songwriting era generated a ridiculous number of tunes. OS also contains an abundance of B-sides and alternate takes..  <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/IInventedPlastic.aspx">I Invented Plastic</A> - (2001) - The first full-length Kindohm CD and the first songs.  <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/EarlyMusicAndClips.aspx">Early Music and Clips</A> - (1995 - 1998) - This compilation contains some really bizarre compositions and sketches. It's what happens when you have extra time on your hands in college. There's also some neat drum machine compositions.  <LI><A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/Remnants.aspx">Remnants</A> - A collection of anything else that isn't really categorized yet. </LI></UL>
