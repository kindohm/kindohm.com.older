title: "I play with electricity"
---

<P>This weekend I finally got all of the basement lighting finished.&nbsp; I don't mind doing electrical work at all, but I hate lighting.&nbsp; The fixtures are crammed up in the ceiling and its difficult to work with.&nbsp; I'll take a switch or outlet near the floor any day over a light fixture.&nbsp; </P> <P>I discovered a big mistake in my approach to wiring the recessed lights in the main living area, so I had to re-wire all of them.&nbsp; The cool thing though is that I've learned a lot and now I feel like I can wire up anything.&nbsp; I didn't fully understand residential circuitry before, and now it's cake.&nbsp; Perhaps the best part about this weekend is that there is <FONT color=#ffa500 size=4><STRONG>light</STRONG></FONT> in the entire basement now.&nbsp; It's not so dull and dark anymore.</P> <P>The only electrical left will be to wire up all of the outlets in the rooms - and I'm not 100% I need to do that for the inspection.&nbsp; Other than that, here's what's left before drywall:</P> <UL> <LI>Install some support framing for electrical boxes and HVAC vents</LI> <LI>Re-do the ceiling framing in the hallway to the bathroom</LI> <LI>Run the bath fan exhaust line to the outside of the house</LI> <LI>Install framing around the music room window</LI> <LI>Run phone lines</LI> <LI>Run cable for and install a smoke detector in the storage room.</LI> <LI>Finish up telephone/data/audio cable drops</LI> <LI>Install insulation</LI></UL> <P>That's about it.&nbsp; I should be able to knock off more than half of that list in a half day.&nbsp; It's getting closer...</P>
