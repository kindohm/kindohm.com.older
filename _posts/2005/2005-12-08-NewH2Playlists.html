title: "A couple of new playlists"
---

<P>If you're still an active Halo 2 gamer, <A href="http://www.bungie.net" target=_blank>Bungie</A> has put out a couple of new matchmaking playlists for Halo 2 that are a bit interesting: <EM><strong>Rumble Armory</strong></EM> and <EM><strong>Team ActionSack</strong></EM>. I have to admit that I think the names are cool :).</P> <P><A href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/page.aspx?section=FAQInfo&amp;subsection=playlists&amp;page=1" target=_blank>Get the details here</A>. Rumble Armory is unranked because it's so bizzare. I played a few of the new playlist games yesterday after work and they were a nice change from the same old slayer/ctf/BR/human games.</P>
