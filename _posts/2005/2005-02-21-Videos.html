<p> <span style="color: red;font-weight: bold;">UPDATE:</span> Unfortunately I haven't really kept up with maintaining this video page or keeping the video links permanent.  Sorry but these links probably won't work.  I'm keeping this page around for archive sake but otherwise it's basically dead.<br /><br /> - Mike, 3/7/2007 </p>  <div id="videos"> <p>Hey.

Basically this is the first footage captured on my Canon Optura 30 camcorder. The soundtrack is an oldie-but-goodie Kindohm original recording from the <em>I Invented Plastic</em> sessions: "Get On Your Knees and Bark Like a Dog" (available on the <em>Material Alternatives</em> disc). What else can I say - this is what happened when audio and video mixed in Mike's presence.</td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> </div>
