title: "How many bad words are in YOUR encoded Guids?"
---

<p>    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx?blog=entry.096e7e68921148ea837a358965314360">     Jason's post</a> piqued my interest in how often an undesirable phrase     reared its ugly head in an encoded string. So, I grabbed a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/Base36.asp" target="blank">     Base36 encoder</a> and went to work.   </p>   <p>My goal was to generate a Guid, encode it as Base36, then see if the encoded value contained a "bad word" [1].  I   did this by running 10 repititions, and each repitition ran a loop 100,000 times.  In each loop I generated the Guid,   performed the encryption, then inspected the encrypted value.</p>   <p>The list of "bad words" doesn't really have to be all that bad.  After all, having the string "DAMN" appear in    a Base36 encrypted value is just as probable as "MIKE".  So here's my list:</p>   <pre><code>
ArrayList badWords = new ArrayList();
badWords.Add("MIKE");
badWords.Add("DAMN");
badWords.Add("DOGS");
badWords.Add("CATS");
badWords.Add("ASDF");
badWords.Add("LOVE");
badWords.Add("SING");
badWords.Add("POOP");
badWords.Add("FOOT");
badWords.Add("ARMY");
badWords.Add("CAVE");
badWords.Add("SANE");
badWords.Add("FISH");
badWords.Add("JUNE");
badWords.Add("CIAO");    
badWords.Add("REST");
badWords.Add("PARK");
badWords.Add("KEEN");
badWords.Add("IONS");
badWords.Add("LIFT");
badWords.Add("RENT");
badWords.Add("DORK");
badWords.Add("SALE");  
  </code></pre>
  <p>After running the test app, here's the output:</p>   <pre><code>

  <p>On average, about 9 "bad words" were found per 100,000 Guids, or 0.009%.</p>   <p>Ok, I have a life to get back to now...  really...</p>   <p>[1] The actual Base36 encryption algorithm and system performance of the entire experiment weren't important to me.   The experiment isn't intended to be used as an accurate or significant statistical model either - I just wanted a quick idea of how often this type of thing happens.</p>
