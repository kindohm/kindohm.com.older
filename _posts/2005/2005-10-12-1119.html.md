<p>The <a href="http://www.medalistband.com/schedule/schedule.html">Bloomington Medalist Concert Band</a> is playing at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2128+South+4th+Street,+Minneapolis,+MN+55455&amp;spn=0.018373,0.034287&amp;hl=en">Ted Mann Concert Hall </a>on Monday 10/17/2005 at 7:30 PM.&nbsp; The best part is that this concert is <strong>FREE</strong>.&nbsp; All of the other Medalist concerts are usually between $5 and $10.&nbsp; This show will feature two other bands from the U of M, and we're playing last.&nbsp; So if you're looking for something to do next Monday, come see me play an array of percussion instruments.</p>
