<P>Look to the right.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; It's cool and you know it.&nbsp; At least you wish you had something like this on <STRONG><EM>your</EM></STRONG> website.</P> <P>I use the <A href="http://www.last.fm" target=_blank>last.fm</A>/<A href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net" target=_blank>Audioscrobbler</A> plugin for WMP, and they make all kinds of XML/REST feeds available for user stats (<a target="_blank" href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/kindohm/topartists.xml">example</a>). I decided to throw my top 100 artists feed on the site just for fun. Now you know what I listen to all day.</P> <P>So when you see Winger get into the top 5, you know there's a bug somewhere.</P>
