I do enjoy the conversation, but what I'm really here for is 
to help you learn new things. What does the flag of Venezuela 
look like?  Ask me, and I might even play its national anthem 
too.

If you can't solve a quadratic equation, how the hell can you 
tell me what a flag looks like?

Encarta&#174; Instant Answers says:
I'm afraid I won't be able to find anything about this in 
the encyclopedia.
Type "?" any time for examples of questions you can ask me.
