title: "Online shopping woes"

<P>I've never purchased a gift for anyone using an online retailer until last week.&nbsp; I bought Nikki a &lt;present&gt; online last Thursday and wanted to have it shipped to my work address so that she wouldn't see it at home.&nbsp; I used 3-day select shipping because I knew I was cutting it close to Dec. 25th.&nbsp; </P> <P>On Saturday I received an email from the retailer saying that my package could not be shipped because the alternate work address was not associated with my credit card account.&nbsp; So, I called my credit card company, set up the new address, replied to the email's sender that I took care of it, and also completed an online customer service form notifying them of the change.&nbsp; </P> <P>I then noticed in the confirmation email from the purchase that the shipping address was incomplete (it didn't include the suite number).&nbsp; I completed another online customer service form notifying them of the change of address.&nbsp; </P> <P>On Monday, I received a call saying that my alternate address was confirmed with the credit card company and that the purchase could be shipped.&nbsp; I also received a confirmation message saying that the suite number was added to the shipping address.&nbsp; Eventually I got a UPS tracking number and I was all set.</P> <P>So yesterday I was supposed to receive the package.&nbsp; It turns out that the suite number was never added to the address and UPS would not deliver the package (they can't just deliver a package to a building with dozens of offices without knowing which office to go to).&nbsp; I attempted to call the retailer's customer service line but was on hold for 30 minutes.&nbsp; I gave up and tried calling UPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;UPS's location finder on their phone system&nbsp;will give you UPS package center addresses but not phone numbers.&nbsp; That didn't help me at all since I really needed to talk to someone about this problem.&nbsp; I didn't want to drive to Eagan where my package was being kept either to talk to someone in person about the problem.&nbsp; It turns out that UPS has a sneaky phone system where they won't tell you that you can talk to an agent at any time by pressing zero.</P> <P>So finally I hooked up with a UPS agent on my cell phone on the way home from work.&nbsp; I described the problem and he was all set to enter the new suite number, when the friggin call gets dropped! [1]&nbsp; Unable to find a suitable object or surface to smash with my fist in the car for fear of the airbag deploying and breaking valuable objects, I resorted to deep breaths and thought of a happy place (the top of a ladder while being danced around by pink elephants wearing snow suits and top hats).&nbsp; I was getting really, really worried that the package wouldn't get to me in time to wrap it and give it to my wife.</P> <P>So I get home and call UPS again, but this time I'm using the land line from the house.&nbsp; I talk to an agent who can help me, but he seems far from the competency that the first agent demonstrated.&nbsp; This new agent proceded to call me &#8220;Jim&#8221; and kept getting the address/suite number wrong whenever I gave him that information.&nbsp; This was not good.&nbsp; I confirmed with him that he had the correct information, but I ended the call with less than 100% certainty that he did his job correctly.</P> <P>So today UPS's site is telling me that the package has been updated with a new delivery address, so at least something happened from the phone calls.&nbsp; The site won't say what the new address is (obviously), so hopefully I'll receive it today.&nbsp; If I don't, then it'll probably be a trip out to the Eagan hub.&nbsp; </P> <P>[1] Do NOT sign a contract with Cingular.&nbsp; Multiple dropped calls per day are not rare.&nbsp; Many of my important conversations on my cell phone often get dropped.&nbsp; This particular call was dropped in Eden Prairie while driving on Highway 5 west.&nbsp; Hardly a rural or low-density area.</P>
