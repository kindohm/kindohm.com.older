<P>For some of you, this is going to be a shock: Nikki and I did <STRONG>not</STRONG> go to Antarctica.&nbsp; We went to the Caribbean.&nbsp; Yes, more than one of you out there bought it and believed me when I said we were going to see penguins, weather stations, and ice shelves.&nbsp; It was more like clear blue water, warm air, and good food.&nbsp; </P> <P>We were on a cruise, and it was excellent.&nbsp; Honestly, I don't know if we'll ever do&nbsp;a <STRONG>Caribbean</STRONG> cruise again (they're a bit too slow-paced for us), but it was still a blast.&nbsp; Last year's <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=9d915efc-3e9a-42a3-8ea6-c88b346272c5">European cruise</A> was a lot faster paced and more fun.&nbsp; We had stops in San Juan, St. Thomas, and Tortola.&nbsp; We were supposed to stop one day in the Bahamas, but the seas were pretty rough that day and they wouldn't let us tender off of the ship to go ashore.&nbsp; </P> <P>So, how did I get the shape of a spoon on my head?&nbsp; I turns out that you can get sunburned in the shade.&nbsp; Nikki and I were already a bit sunburned, so one day we decided to go out and read on the boat's deck in the shade.&nbsp; After 4.5 hours, both of us were bright red on one half of our bodies.&nbsp; I was wearing sunglasses the whole time, and it resulted in a big white patch over my left eye with a straight stripe going back to my ear (e.g. a &#8220;spoon&#8221; shape).&nbsp; The other side of me didn't get burned so it was only one half of my face.&nbsp; It looked rather odd.&nbsp; We figured we got burned because the sun reflected enough off of the plexiglass half-wall that was part of the rail on the deck.&nbsp; </P> <P>Pictures from the trip are <A href="http://kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=7c52c93n-3ee9-485b-a2c6-bd7ea16b21te">here</A>.&nbsp; Sorry, but the images aren't really labeled at all.&nbsp; I'll try and take care of that in the near future.</P>
