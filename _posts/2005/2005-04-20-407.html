<P>I'm very relieved to hear this:</P> <P><A href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=122214&amp;hubName=nhl">NHL Board of Governors End Meeting</A> [<A href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=122214&amp;hubName=nhl" target=_blank>^</A>]</P> <P><EM>&#8220;'If we don't have a new&nbsp;[Collective&nbsp;Bargaining Agreement]&nbsp;so that our players can start the season with us in October, we will not open on time,'&nbsp;Bettman said following a four-hour meeting with owners and GMs.&#8220;</EM></P> <P>I was very fearful that we'd be seeing scab players next year.&nbsp; If that were to have been the case, I don't know that I would have gone to any NHL games next year unless the ticket prices were significantly lowered.&nbsp; Lower quality product, lower prices.&nbsp; </P> <P>If the NHL and NHLPA get their act together with a new labor agreement, they'll keep the high quality product on the ice and I'll pay the regular price for my season tickets.&nbsp; Otherwise it'd be a rip off.&nbsp; </P> <P>Whether or not the next&nbsp;season will actually start on time is a different story.&nbsp; I'm not optimistic at the moment.&nbsp; I've lost a lot of my faith in the two parties and I don't see much evidence that they'll make progress.</P>
