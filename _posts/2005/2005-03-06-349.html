<P>It's been a while since I've posted about how the basement is coming, so here's an update.&nbsp; </P> <P>In general I'm a little frustrated with the pace of the project right now.&nbsp; I'm only working on it about one day a week (usually Sundays), and at this pace&nbsp;I just don't think it'll get done before the baby comes in August.&nbsp; I'm going to try and start working on it a couple of weeknights a week, Saturdays, AND Sundays to try and boost things along.</P> <P>Today I primarily worked on wiring.&nbsp; I had to re-run some cables across the rooms because the sheathing was ripped.&nbsp; One word of advice: if you're running cable that tends to have a lot of friction to it, don't force it through your holes in your ceiling joists.&nbsp; You just damage the cable and have to do it over.&nbsp; Then I ran some cable in the hallway circuit for outlets and the ceiling light.&nbsp; </P> <P>I also finished up the hallway ceiling frame.&nbsp; There's a small box I had to build around some ductwork to complete the frame, and I just strengthened it&nbsp;with some more screws.&nbsp; </P> <P>The next steps later this week will be to secure some loose cables in the ceiling and re-fit a vertical enclosure I built around some other ductwork in the soundproof room.&nbsp; Some idiot secured it into place without checking if all the angles were 90 degrees from the walls.&nbsp; I also need to check with the Chaska inspector to see if they have any rules on electrical cable being near or touching ductwork.&nbsp; </P> <P>Then there's the recessed lights and the mother of a soffit we'll be building around the main duct trunks.&nbsp; </P>
