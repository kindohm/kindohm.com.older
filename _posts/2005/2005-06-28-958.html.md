<p>The coolest thing I've seen in the last five minutes: <a href="http://earth.google.com/">http://earth.google.com/</a></p>
<p>Not sure if I'll ever use this for anything other than wasting time, but I could see this being useful for visualizing a driving route or finding restaurants/businesses in places I'm visiting.&nbsp; The animation of the maps is very cool, and the &#8220;tilt&#8221; angles are even better.&nbsp; The tilt is really what puts the icing on the cake to me.&nbsp; Even though it's 2D data, the angled visualization makes a huge difference in following a route.&nbsp; </p>
