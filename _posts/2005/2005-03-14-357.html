<P>I don't know why, but these things just get on my nerves sometimes :)&nbsp; Maybe this will turn into a top 10 or top 50...</P> <OL> <LI>2 seconds into the game you hear, <STRONG>&#8220;What game are we playing"</STRONG>? As if the description in the pre-game lobby and the guy with the deep voice saying <I>"Capture the Flag"</I> aren't enough.</LI> <LI><STRONG>"Did I kill you"</STRONG>? You should easily be able to tell whether you killed someone by a) seeing if they're still standing and b) reading the message on your screen that says <I>"You killed &lt;playername&gt;"</I>.</LI> <LI><STRONG>"Who killed me"</STRONG>? Again, you can easily find this out by reading the message on your screen that says <I>"&lt;playername&gt; killed you"</I>.</LI></OL> <P>Feel free to add your own.</P>
