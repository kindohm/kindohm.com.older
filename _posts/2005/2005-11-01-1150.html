<P>If you haven't ever visited <A href="http://www.halowiki.net">www.halowiki.net</A>,&nbsp;I recommend it.&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;I first saw it months ago, it was pretty unorganized and the content&nbsp;was written very poorly.&nbsp; Hence the beauty of a&nbsp;wiki:&nbsp;the quality of the site&nbsp;has improved over time&nbsp;through its contributions from the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;The types of information presented on the site has also evolved over time.&nbsp; It&nbsp;began&nbsp;with simple information about weapons and maps, but now includes an abundance of articles on&nbsp;strategies and tactics ranging from general gameplay to specific game types.&nbsp; </P> <P>What recently caught my attention was&nbsp;this article on playing defense in&nbsp;CTF and Assault games:&nbsp;<A href="http://h2wiki.halowiki.net/wiki/Defence">http://h2wiki.halowiki.net/wiki/Defence</A>.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;concise and talks about some points of play that may seem obvious, but when put into practice are very effective.&nbsp; </P> <P>On a side note, my interest in <A href="http://www.bungie.net">H2</A> is picking up again after our last <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/09/20/1084.aspx">LAN party</A>.&nbsp; We're attempting to organize another game night over XBox live in the next few weeks.&nbsp; If you're interested, let me know.</P>
