<p>I just picked up some <A href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=MDREX51LP&amp;Dept=pa&amp;CategoryName=pa_PADepartmentAccessories_Headphones_Fontopia%2e%2fEarbud">Sony MDR-EX51LP headphones</A> [<A href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=MDREX51LP&amp;Dept=pa&amp;CategoryName=pa_PADepartmentAccessories_Headphones_Fontopia%2e%2fEarbud" target=_blank>^</A>].&nbsp; I highly recommend them - nice and small, fit snugly in your ear, and they pack a lot of low end even though they're tiny.&nbsp; They come with a variety of earbuds of different sizes to try out, plus a neat little carrying case.&nbsp; I haven't had a nice compact pair of headphones like these in years.</p>
