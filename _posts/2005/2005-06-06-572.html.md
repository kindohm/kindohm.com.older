title: "I play with electricity"
---

<p>This weekend I finally got all of the basement lighting finished.&nbsp; I don't mind doing electrical work at all, but I hate lighting.&nbsp; The fixtures are crammed up in the ceiling and its difficult to work with.&nbsp; I'll take a switch or outlet near the floor any day over a light fixture.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I discovered a big mistake in my approach to wiring the recessed lights in the main living area, so I had to re-wire all of them.&nbsp; The cool thing though is that I've learned a lot and now I feel like I can wire up anything.&nbsp; I didn't fully understand residential circuitry before, and now it's cake.&nbsp; Perhaps the best part about this weekend is that there is <font color="#ffa500" size="4"><strong>light</strong></font> in the entire basement now.&nbsp; It's not so dull and dark anymore.</p>
<p>The only electrical left will be to wire up all of the outlets in the rooms - and I'm not 100% I need to do that for the inspection.&nbsp; Other than that, here's what's left before drywall:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Install some support framing for electrical boxes and HVAC vents</li> 
<li>Re-do the ceiling framing in the hallway to the bathroom</li> 
<li>Run the bath fan exhaust line to the outside of the house</li> 
<li>Install framing around the music room window</li> 
<li>Run phone lines</li> 
<li>Run cable for and install a smoke detector in the storage room.</li> 
<li>Finish up telephone/data/audio cable drops</li> 
<li>Install insulation</li></ul> 
<p>That's about it.&nbsp; I should be able to knock off more than half of that list in a half day.&nbsp; It's getting closer...</p>
