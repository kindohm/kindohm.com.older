<P><A href="http://www.jasonbock.net/" target=_blank>Jason</A> and I have officially launched the site for our collaborative musical project: <A href="http://www.sidetrackedproject.net/" target=_blank>The Sidetracked Project</A>. Go check it out. Learn all about it.</P> <P>I'm really stoked about it. It's the first time I've really ever done any musical/songwriting collaboration with anyone, and it's been a blast so far in its short existence. My own music is fun, but I think this is going to be pretty damn good.</P>
