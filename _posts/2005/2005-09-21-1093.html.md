title: "Avalon 3D Tutorial"
---

<p>I've posted a tutorial on creating 3D objects in Avalon:  <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/technical/WPF3DTutorial.htm">http://www.kindohm.com/technical/WPF3DTutorial.htm</a>.  It's complete with Mike's crash course in 3D graphics theory, code samples, and screenshots.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the tutorial is to help 3D graphics novices (like me) past some of the fundamentals of 3D graphics theory.  I had a hard time finding out any of the basics of the topic when I was looking into 3D in Avalon, and I thought it'd be good to help people gain that understanding more quickly than I did.  </p>
