title: "The crazy NHL offseason"
---

<p>This NHL offseason may end up being the most memorable in NHL history.&nbsp; Now that the new CBA is in place and there are significantly new rules on team payroll and free agency, I expect to see a lot of high-profile NHL'ers being shuffled around before the season starts in October.&nbsp; Teams like the New York Rangers, Detroit, Dallas, Colorado, and Philadelphia will have some difficult decisions to make in the next few months [1].&nbsp; A team like the Red Wings that is loaded with high-caliber and high-priced stars won't be able to keep them all because of the&nbsp; new salary cap.&nbsp; </p>
<p>TSN has a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/feature.asp?fid=10407">2005 Transaction Log</a>&nbsp;that shows all of the activity so far.&nbsp; I expect this list to grow very quickly within the next month as teams make their decisions on who to let go and who to keep.&nbsp; So far, it's interesting to see what teams have been doing.&nbsp; Teams like Detroit and Philly have been buying out some of their older and higher paid players (e.g. LeClair and Hatcher).&nbsp; I'm interested in seeing where players like that end up.&nbsp; It'd be very weird to see great players like that not get signed by another team.&nbsp; After all the teams in the league trim the fat off their payroll this offseason, I think there will be a lot of formerly high-paid players looking for work.&nbsp; Unless they're willing to take a pay cut, they'll be out of a job.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In particular, I'm curious to see who the Rangers let go: Jagr, Lindros, Messier, Holik, Weeks, Dunham, Kasparaitis...&nbsp; they can't keep all of them.&nbsp; And if those players are willing to take a pay cut, can you imagine somebody like Jagr playing for a team that has room to grow in their payroll (e.g. Nashville or Minnesota)?</p>
