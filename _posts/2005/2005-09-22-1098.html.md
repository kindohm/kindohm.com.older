<p>Look to the right.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; It's cool and you know it.&nbsp; At least you wish you had something like this on <strong><em>your</em></strong> website.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="http://www.last.fm" target="_blank">last.fm</a>/<a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net" target="_blank">Audioscrobbler</a> plugin for WMP, and they make all kinds of XML/REST feeds available for user stats (<a target="_blank" href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/kindohm/topartists.xml">example</a>). I decided to throw my top 100 artists feed on the site just for fun. Now you know what I listen to all day.</p>
<p>So when you see Winger get into the top 5, you know there's a bug somewhere.</p>
