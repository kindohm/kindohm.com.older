<p>I've officially thrown myself in to the world of video production.&nbsp; At least at the extreme amateur level - and I emphasize the <em>amateur</em> part.&nbsp; With the recent purchase of my <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=114&amp;modelid=10079">Canon Optura 30</a> [<a target="_blank" href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=114&amp;modelid=10079">^</a>] digital camcorder, I immediately began experimenting and created a music video for an old Kindohm tune.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, check out the video on the <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/02/21/Videos.aspx">Kindohm Videos page</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Feedback, questions, comments, criticism, and large sums of money are welcome.&nbsp; </p>
