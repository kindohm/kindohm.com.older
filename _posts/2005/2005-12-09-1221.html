title: "Truth about the Wild and the Penguins"
---

<P>I've talked a number of times about how the Pittsburgh Penguins would be all hype this year and that their expectations were set too high (<A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/09/09/1065.aspx">The Trap Will Not Die</A>, <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/09/12/1073.aspx">Lemieux's Expectations</A>, and <A href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/10/20/1124.aspx">Beginning the Quest for the Cup</A>). I've contrasted the Wild and the Pens and how the Wild will have a much more solid season than the Pens because of their solid defensive play. Despite the new NHL rule changes, strong defense will beat a team with a weak defense most of the time.</P> <P>So last night the truth came out and the Wild visited the Pens. Wild 5, Pens 0. Sidney Crosby and company were shut down and shut out. </P> <P>Details: <A href="http://www.nhl.com/scores/boxscores/418_2_boxscore.html">http://www.nhl.com/scores/boxscores/418_2_boxscore.html</A>.</P> <P>Now, the Wild are arguably having a poor season this year, but this was the Wild vs. the Penguins. This was two teams who are arguably complete opposites in how their players, coaching, and management approach the game. A 5-0 shutout makes a pretty strong case for which club has the better approach.&nbsp; Until Pittsburgh owner Lemieux swallows his pride and stops&nbsp;criticizing defensive teams for ruining the game and play some defense himself, the Penguins will keep losing.</P>
