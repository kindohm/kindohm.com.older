<P>I've always wanted one of <A href="http://store1.yimg.com/I/artshowgallery_1846_20497964" target=_blank>these</A>.&nbsp; And now I have one!&nbsp; Nikki gave it to me as a belated Christmas present last night.&nbsp; It's a print of a panoramic photo of the Minnesota Wild's inaugural game at the XCel Energy Center.&nbsp; It's an excellent picture, and a perfect gift.&nbsp; Nikki is the best :)</P>
