title: "To death with Hungarian notation"
---

<P>Just a little rant while I wait for a build process to complete...</P> <P>To death with <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" target=_blank>Hungarian notation</A>.  It's useless and has no place in modern languages and IDEs.  What's the point of prefixing fields when all of your prefixes begin with &#8220;obj&#8221;?  </P>
