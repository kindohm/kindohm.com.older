title: "My wife called me a Computer Geek"
---

<P>Suddenly I've immersed myself in a number of programming and website related tasks.&nbsp; It's been a long time since I've wanted to stay hunched over my keyboard while I'm at home, but now it's like my inner-geek wants out and I'm letting it have its way because its been locked up for so long.&nbsp; </P> <P>So as you've probably guessed by now, I've redesigned my website.&nbsp; It's like clockwork.&nbsp; About once every two months I get my mind set on updating the site and creating a new skin.&nbsp; I've done it so many times now that it probably only takes me about 4 - 5 hours to do.&nbsp; Basically, I got the urge late, late, late last night and threw it together.&nbsp; I put a little more effort into this one with some subtle graphics to help smooth things out.&nbsp; Originally I had a vision for an army green color with orange highlights, but it really looked stupid.&nbsp; So, I'm sticking with blue.&nbsp; Blue rocks.</P> <P>I've also been looking into <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/default.aspx">Avalon</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's&nbsp;research for <A href="http://www.inetium.com">work</A>, but I've become pretty consumed in wanting to learn more about it.&nbsp; So far I've gone over the basics of creating Windows applications with Avalon, but now I really want to dive under the hood and get a deep understanding of what it <EM>really</EM> is and how it <EM>really</EM> works.&nbsp; </P> <P>I think it's somewhat ironic that while I'm looking at Avalon, and I'm also getting into GDI+ for the first time.&nbsp; I've done next to no work with graphics in Windows apps in .Net 1.x.&nbsp; Anyway, I'll just say that I have an idea that involves GDI+ in .Net, 2000 US census data, and United States geography.&nbsp; I don't know where this idea is going to go yet, but I plan on blogging about it as I&nbsp;find time.&nbsp; </P> <P>When am I actually going to have time to do any of this stuff?&nbsp; I have no idea.&nbsp; I've already been <A href="http://www.sidetrackedproject.net/SP/news/jason/archive/2005/06/22/54.aspx">cancelling</A> other personal activities and have been insanely busy with other <A href="http://www.medalistband.com/schedule/schedule.html">rehearsals, concerts</A>, working on the <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/30.aspx">basement</A>, <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/LanPartyDetail.aspx?PartyID=21387376">LAN parties</A>, childbirth classes, and&nbsp;maintaining the evil entity&nbsp;that is known as my lawn.&nbsp; We'll see what happens.&nbsp; </P>
