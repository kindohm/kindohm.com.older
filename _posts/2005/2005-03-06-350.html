title: "VirtualPuck.com - not dead, but on life support"
---

<P>I'm kinda bummed about this, but I've decided to put away plans for VirtualPuck.com - at least for a year or so, if not forever.  I haven't touched it in almost two months, life is getting busier, and other things are taking priority (basement, baby planning, studying for my next MCSD, building a deck, on-the-side music projects, pole vaulting, alpaca training, etc...).  I just don't want to put out something that's not as good as it can be, and I just can't get it to that point right now.  Depending on how things look a year from now I may hit it full steam again.  </P> <P>Some folks out there were looking forward to it, so I apologize.  I'll make it up to you with some extra-large Meat Malts - just like the ones they make at the Ottawa arena.  </P>
