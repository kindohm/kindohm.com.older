<p><strong>Steelers/Patriots</strong></p>
<p>I'm a little bummed that the Steelers didn't win.&nbsp; I like to pull for the underdog.&nbsp; Even though the Steelers were seeded #1, the Patriots have been to the super bowl enough recently that I wanted to see them lose.&nbsp; I'm not suprised the Pats won though because they are one of the greatest examples of a &#8220;team&#8220;.&nbsp; Everyone pulls their weight, and that's how you win.</p>
<p><strong>Eagles/Falcons</strong></p>
<p>No suprise with the outcome of this game, but I have a little rant about this one.&nbsp; The commentators (Joe Buck, et. al.) mentioned that McNabb said that he would &#8220;carry the team on his shoulders&#8221; and bring them a win.&nbsp; I hate crap like that.&nbsp; It's just the opposite of the Pat's &#8220;team&#8221;.&nbsp; It's one guy&nbsp;that thinks he can&nbsp;win it by himself.&nbsp; Yeah the team is riding a wave and I'm sure&nbsp;McNabb's teamates don't mind right now, but I just really dislike the attitude.&nbsp; To me he's saying that he doesn't think the rest of his team is good enough to win when in reality he really needs them.&nbsp; That's one reason why I love hockey so much...&nbsp; you don't get the &#8220;I'm going to carry the team&#8221; mentality&nbsp;in hockey.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bowl Prediction</strong></p>
<p>Patriots will win 24-10 and will solidify themselves as the latest sports dynasty.&nbsp; They will win because of what I've already stated above: they all pull their own weight, give you 60 minutes, and none of them would&nbsp;consider pulling out a Sharpie after a touchdown.&nbsp; The Eagles have skills, but the Pats are a complete team.</p>
