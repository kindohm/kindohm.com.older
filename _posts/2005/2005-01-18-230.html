<P>Bravo.</P> <P><A href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=111647&amp;hubName=nhl">Link</A></P> <P>This time it feels like the talks will be a bit more genuine.&nbsp; The two biggest factors in the negotiations, Goodenow and Bettman, won't be participating.&nbsp; Nor will a large number of reps from the players or league sides as in the past.&nbsp; Since both sides have such differing views to begin with, I'm not optimistic a deal will be reached.&nbsp; However, I think this is the best chance that they will have to reach an agreement.&nbsp; Props to Linden.&nbsp; It's at least good to see that the NHLPA players' rep, symbolically the most important player in the negotiations, wants to see an agreement and has a genuine concern.&nbsp; I've never gotten that feeling from Goodenow or Bettman.&nbsp; </P> <P>Having no NHL hockey is killing me this year.&nbsp; </P>
