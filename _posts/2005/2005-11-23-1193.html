title: "Back at it with Halo 2"
---

<P><A href="http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx" target=_blank>Jason</A> just posted on a <A href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/GameStats.aspx?gameID=353823058&amp;player=Kindohm" target=_blank>Halo 2 game</A> that we played last night, and I just wanted to chime in and agree with him that it's good to be playing the game again. The honeymoon with Halo 2 and the excitement of matching up with players online to play the game wore off a long, long time ago. When the game came out we were all in love with the matchmaking, new maps, RSS feeds, and online stats. Like most new things, it eventually got old. But now I'm back at it again, eager to play at night. I think now it's because I'm interested in some competition and a little challenge. I don't pay attention to the thrill of Halo 2 so much as focusing on strategies and tactics. </P> <P>It's different now though with having a little baby girl to take of.&nbsp; I can't just sit down and play anytime I want.&nbsp; I could play after she goes to bed around 10:30 almost any night, but since she wakes up at 5:00 that'd make for a short night of sleep.&nbsp; Planning on playing on Tuesday nights like we have been makes it easier though.&nbsp; Then Nikki knows that she'll need to take care of her for a few hours before bedtime on&nbsp;Tuesdays&nbsp;[1].</P> <P>So now I'm getting eager to plan the next <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/archive/2005/06/24/LanParties.aspx">LAN party</A> too. Maybe in January after the holidays... </P> <P>[1] As if Nikki doesn't already take care of Eva enough all by herself.&nbsp; I have a wonderful wife :)</P>
