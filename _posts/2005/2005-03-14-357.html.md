<p>I don't know why, but these things just get on my nerves sometimes :)&nbsp; Maybe this will turn into a top 10 or top 50...</p>
<ol> 
<li>2 seconds into the game you hear, <strong>&#8220;What game are we playing"</strong>? As if the description in the pre-game lobby and the guy with the deep voice saying <em>"Capture the Flag"</em> aren't enough.</li> 
<li><strong>"Did I kill you"</strong>? You should easily be able to tell whether you killed someone by a) seeing if they're still standing and b) reading the message on your screen that says <em>"You killed &lt;playername&gt;"</em>.</li> 
<li><strong>"Who killed me"</strong>? Again, you can easily find this out by reading the message on your screen that says <em>"&lt;playername&gt; killed you"</em>.</li>
</ol> 
<p>Feel free to add your own.</p>
