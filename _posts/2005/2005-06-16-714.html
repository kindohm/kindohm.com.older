<P>I just bought a set of these:</P> <P><A href="http://www.dwdrums.com/pedals/7000Pedals.htm" target=_blank><IMG src="http://www.samash.com/images/items/lg_d7002PTxx.jpg" border=0></A></P> <P>I haven't bought any drum equipment in... years? I don't know exactly how long, but I think it's been more than two years. I also bought some new drumheads and sticks with the pedals. I tried these out at Guitar Center on Monday, but they didn't have them in stock and I ordered them online at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.samash.com">samash.com</a>. For the money they were the best. My first choice would have been some Tama Iron Cobras but I'm not willing to spend that much. And they're built much tougher than what I'll be using them for. </P>
