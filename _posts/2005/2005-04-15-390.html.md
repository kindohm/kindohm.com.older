title: "Just like old times - Halo - CE"

<p>One of the benefits of <a href="http://www.inetium.com" target="_blank">where I work</a> 
	is our <font color="#a52a2a">*</font>Brain Lounge: a place to sit on a couch, 
	fire up an XBox, unwind and let your developer troubles go away for a few minutes.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.whoisjake.com" target="_blank">Jake</a> and 
	I fired up some good ol' Halo: Combat Evolved for a couple of duels.&nbsp; 
	That was the first time I've played Halo CE since, oh, maybe September or 
	so.&nbsp; I was expecting to be a bit suprised at the difference in the 
	game's feel compared to Halo 2, and it definately took a bit of getting 
	used to.&nbsp; For a few moments it felt really foreign, but it was very 
	interesting to observe some of the game subtleties (or lack thereof) in 
	comparison to Halo 2.&nbsp; Less crisp graphics, sloppier movoement, 
	different physics...&nbsp; and no dual wielding! :)</p>
<p>I lost 15-6 in Slayer on Prisoner (damn those health-reducing falls), 
	and lost 25-21 in Rockets on Prisoner.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font color="#a52a2a">*</font> The &#8220;Brain Lounge&#8221; isn't 
	officially named yet.&nbsp; We <em>supposedly</em> had a naming 
	contest for our conference rooms, but it's been weeks and there 
	are no results.&nbsp; Something's fishy...</p>
