title: "Electricity - Adventures in Basement Remodeling (w/ pictures)"
---

<P>Today I made some decent progress on our basement.&nbsp; I started the &#8220;Electrical&#8221; phase of the project and ran cabling for the outlets in the music room and living room.&nbsp; Nikki's step-father came over to help too, which sped up the process significantly.&nbsp; This is about as far as I can&nbsp;go with&nbsp;the electrical work for now until Nikki and I decide what we want to do for lighting.&nbsp; Once we figure that out, there'll be a lot more cable to run.&nbsp; </P> <P>I <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=7bbff611-6476-7170-b7c4-3e25685c8e4f">took a few pictures</A> to document the day.&nbsp; I also added a <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=7be664fc-9878-4d72-b30f-67bc4e5ezz15">new subfolder for ductwork</A> in the <A href="http://www.kindohm.com/ImageFolder.aspx?FolderID=c8ee24f6-eb3e-4ab3-bec3-3b40feae229f">BasementProject image library</A>.&nbsp; Nothing too exciting, but it shows all the custom ductwork we've put in so far.&nbsp; </P> <P>With luck and a lot of will-power, the basement will be completely wired up by the middle of February.&nbsp; By March, all of the framing might be complete.&nbsp; And by mid-March all of the drywall might be up.&nbsp; And by summer the whole project might be done.&nbsp; With no luck and my usual procrastination, it'll be done next winter.&nbsp; :)</P>
