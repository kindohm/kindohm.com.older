title: "So you wanna be a SharePoint developer?"
---

<p>Recently I've been asked a number of times what SharePoint development is and what the required skills are.&nbsp; I find that most people tend to assume it's about product functionality and working with out-of-the-box customizations&nbsp;with sites, lists, document libraries, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mike Fitzmaurice's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikefitz/archive/2005/03/15/396176.aspx" target="_blank">Good "SharePoint Development" = Good .NET Development</a> post and Gregory S. Macbeth's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gregmcb/archive/2004/10/25/247388.aspx" target="_blank">SharePoint Developers Road Map</a> post provide some very good perspectives on what is required of SharePoint developers. </p>
