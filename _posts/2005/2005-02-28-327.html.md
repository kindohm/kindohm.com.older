<p>The <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2004/12/28/Halo2MPTips.aspx">Halo 2 Tips</a> post has been viewed over 2230 times since posting it exactly two months ago. That's about 38 hits a day. For someone who's never had a site with much traffic at all, I'm kinda happy about this :) And it's also ranking 8th on a Google search for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=halo+2+multiplayer+tips" target="_blank">Halo 2 multiplayer tips</a>". It's a bit insignificant in the big intarweb<span style="FONT-SIZE: 6pt; VERTICAL-ALIGN: super">1</span>, but I'm happy about it :)</p>
