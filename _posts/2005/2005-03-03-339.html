title: "Telligent Systems Community Server - a quick evaluation"
---

<P>I downloaded the 1.0 release of <A href="http://www.telligentsystems.com/">Telligent Systems</A> [<A href="http://www.telligentsystems.com/" target=_blank>^</A>] <A href="http://www.communityserver.org/">Community Server</A> [<A href="http://www.communityserver.org/" target=_blank>^</A>] last night and spent about 5 hours giving it a test drive.&nbsp; There are a lot of things I like, and a few things I don't like.</P> <P>First, I'm really happy about all the features that come with it: blogs, forums, and image galleries.&nbsp; It's a ton of functionality that&nbsp;all comes right out of the box.&nbsp; This makes it extremely easy to get up and running with a &#8220;community&#8220; based site.&nbsp; Each main feature is highly customizable and is easily configured, in my opinion.&nbsp; As time goes on there may be a few features here and there that I think of that I wished were in there, but right off the bat it's full of stuff.</P> <P>Perhaps the greatest thing about CS is how easy it is to install it.&nbsp; No more messy SQL scripts or hacking through web.config files.&nbsp; Instead, you just upload or copy the app files to your web server and run a wizard from the installation directory.&nbsp; The wizard sets up the database and does everything for you.&nbsp; Nice.</P> <P>I'm big on skinning, and CS blogs improve their skinning capabilities over the old .Text.&nbsp; The skinning controls are better designed and organized this time around.</P> <P>What I don't like is that Telligent Systems has positioned CS strictly as a multi-user community application, in my opinion. You'll have to get your hands dirty if you want to use it for just a single-user, single-blog type of site by peeling away some of the outer layers that surround the blog functionality. For example, there is a home page, a blogs home page, and then finally the blogs themselves. From what I saw there is no way to just disable those first few pages. In order to maintain a consistent look and feel across all of the "layers", some effort is required - it's just not a single blog skin but skins for the blog aggregate page and the home page.</P> <P>So if I decide to get my hands dirty, dig in, and modify the app such that those outer layers aren't visible, all is good right? I don't think the answer is "yes". It appears that the blogging folder structure used by CS will need to be enforced. Meaning that I can't just use www.kindohm.com for my blog root, which is what I do now. Instead it'd be something like www.kindohm.com/blogs/mikes_blog. In addition, I have some blog posts with permalinks that are indexed by Google and frequently visited. As far as I can tell, those permalinks will all be lost. There is a .Text upgrade that you can perform, but I don't see how the permalinks would remain the same.</P> <P>And the same goes for the RSS feeds. Since blogs are buried a bit under some folders, my current feed (www.kindohm.com/rss.aspx) will break because it won't exist any more. </P> <P>I guess I was just expecting more of a seamless upgrade from .Text.</P> <P>So my final verdict is that it's a sweet product, but I'm skeptical that it'll really fit with how I'd like to use it in my site. I could just bite the bullet and lose my permalinks and not be such a nerd about site traffic :)</P> <P>By the way, if you'd like to download CS 1.0 but have difficulty finding the link to download the bits, you can find it at <A href="http://docs.communityserver.org/">http://docs.communityserver.org</A> [<A href="http://docs.communityserver.org/" target=_blank>^</A>].</P>
