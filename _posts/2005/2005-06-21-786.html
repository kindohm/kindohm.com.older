title: "Halo 2 LAN party this Friday"
---

<P>If you know me and want to come to a Halo 2 LAN party, let me know.&nbsp; It's out in Victoria, so it'll be a bit of a drive for a lot of folks, but not for me :)&nbsp; So far we'll have 6 Xboxes/TV's to use and about 10 people.&nbsp; It'll be a huge mix of people with some regular die-hards coming from Duluth and some newbies from around the area.&nbsp; It won't necessarily be filled with intense, skilled matches, but the emphasis will be on talking smack and having a lot of fun (can you say Neelder-ball??!!&nbsp; hrm, maybe not).&nbsp; </P> <P>I'm hoping to maybe bring along a notepad to jot down what games we play and any other interesting information.&nbsp; I'll post what happened if I actually remember to write stuff.&nbsp; Should be a good time.</P>
