<div><p>Introducing kSynth.Drone - a digital audio synthesizer gadget written in C# for Silverlight 3.</p>  <p>Try it out: <a href="http://kindohm.com/kSynth.Drone" target="_blank"><a href="http://kindohm.com/kSynth.Drone" target="_blank">http://kindohm.com/kSynth.Drone</a></a>. I&#8217;ve also included a <a href="http://kindohm.com/kSynth.Drone/DroneHelp.htm" target="_blank">help page</a>.</p>  <p><img src="/hodsmedia/286889347_1.png" alt=""/></p>  <p>kSynth.Drone is a <em>gadget</em> and is not meant to be a tool used to make music. It&#8217;s meant to be a fun tool to craft interesting sounds using well-known building blocks of digital audio synthesis, such as oscillators, amplitude and frequency modulators, and dynamic envelopes.</p>  <p>This is the third release in the kSynth &#8220;series&#8221;.  If you haven&#8217;t seen the previous apps, they include <a href="http://kindohm.com/kSynth" target="_blank">the original kSynth</a> and <a href="http://kindohm.com/kSynth.b" target="_blank">kSynth.b</a>.  Both of those apps are more musical in nature than kSynth.Drone.</p>  <p>The inspiration for this app came from the desire to create any possible sound from basic digital audio synthesis components and to create a flexible user interface that wouldn&#8217;t look like a synthesizer deck or a bunch of knobs.</p>  <p>This app also utilizes a <a href="http://hodnick.com/post/235627185/fluentaudioprogress" target="_blank">fluent Silverlight audio synthesis API</a> behind the scenes.  I haven&#8217;t yet released this API yet for anyone else to use and hope to in the very near future.  I&#8217;d love to see other developers utilize the API to create interesting audio synthesis apps in Silverlight.</p>  <p>Hope you enjoy!</p></div>
