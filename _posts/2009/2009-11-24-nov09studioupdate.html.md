title: "November &amp;#039;09 Studio Update"
---


<p>I&#8217;ve been busy making music this month in my home-within-my-home.</p>

<p>I have five songs in the hopper right now.  One song is fully written and recording the final tracks is basically a formality at this point.  The music was actually resurrected from an old demo recording from about 2002.  The song is about being abducted by robots.  Very emotional.  Two other songs are musically complete with no lyrics.  One of those is also a resurrection from 2002.  The other is a variation on a theme that has been in the works for a few years, and was actually released in one form on the song &#8220;<a href="http://hodsaudio.net/Song/Details/160" target="_blank">Skill Druids</a>&#8221;. The last two songs are rough around all edges and still need work.</p>












  
<p>I had two other tunes in the works but they&#8217;ve been scrapped.  The more I write and record, the more I learn what 1) I like and 2) I can pull off.  I&#8217;m finding I can scrap stuff that will sound like crap more quickly than I used to.  That&#8217;s a good thing at this point in my life as free time is hard to come by.</p>












  
<p>These new tunes will be &#8220;released&#8221; under the Skill Druids name.  I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;ll only be the five songs or if there will be more.  I can guarantee it&#8217;ll be some nice, heavy, classic Mike Hodnick rock.</p>
