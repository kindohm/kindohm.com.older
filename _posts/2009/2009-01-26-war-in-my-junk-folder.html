title: "War in my Junk folder"
---

<p>All of my internet downloads go to a Junk folder.  By default, I assume that everything I download is junk.  I have a script that I run periodically that deletes the contents of my junk folder.  If I want to keep anything, I have to move it out.</p> <p>I just looked at the contents of my junk folder and got a chuckle:</p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/WarinmyJunkfolder_BE14/junk.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="380" alt="junk" src="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/WarinmyJunkfolder_BE14/junk_thumb.png" width="565" border="0" /></a></p> <p> </p> <p>I think SharePoint is going to lose.  </p>
