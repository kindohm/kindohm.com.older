title: "WPF 3D at MN Silverlight/WPF User Group June 16"
---

<p>I'll be presenting at the Minnesota Silverlight/WPF User Group on June 16, 2009.  The topic will be 3D construction basics with Windows Presentation Foundation. </p>  <p>The session will be at noon at the Microsoft office in Bloomington, MN.  You can sign up for the event at the link below, but the sign up link appears to be broken: <a title="http://ilmservice.com/silverlight/default.aspx" href="http://ilmservice.com/silverlight/default.aspx">http://ilmservice.com/silverlight/default.aspx</a></p>  <p>I last presented on this topic last Fall at a Twin Cities Code Camp.  I'll have to dust off that code and maybe find something new to spice it up with.  Nothing like spicy code, I always say.  </p>  <div id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:7191aa9f-cea7-4f7d-a796-bd66d5771a89" class="tags">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/silverlight" rel="tag">silverlight</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/wpf" rel="tag">wpf</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/3d" rel="tag">3d</a></div>
