<div><p>I&#8217;m nearing another kSynth release named <strong>kSynth.Canvas</strong>.  This app focuses on designing your own digitally synthesized sound through multiple waveform oscillators, frequency modulators, amplitude modulators, and dynamic (attack/sustain/release) envelopes.</p>  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/4185777421/" title="kSynth.Canvas Preview by kindohm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2624/4185777421_b35f62a2c6.jpg" style="border: 0px;" width="500" height="461" alt="kSynth.Canvas Preview"/></a></p>  <p>The user interface emphasizes that each component in the software could be treated like a physical component that you would plug in to another component.  The core of the UI is the concept of a &#8220;channel&#8221;, which most simply consists of an oscillator (sine/saw/square/triangle wave generator), panner (right-left), and volume control.  You can add as many channels as you want to the canvas and they all get mixed to the final left/right channels.</p>  <p>Beyond the basic oscillator/panner/volume, each oscillator has a frequency modulator and an amplitude modulator.  The frequency and amplitude modulators both have a dynamic envelope control that allow you to specify the attack, sustain, and release parameters of the modulation.  The oscillator itself also has a dynamic envelope that allows you to create soft sounds that fade in and out or abrupt, sharp, staccato sounds.</p>  <p>Currently, I&#8217;m working on a sequencer that will allow you to play a simple melodic pattern with the sound you&#8217;ve created.  I&#8217;d also like to add in a delay effect (which I&#8217;ve already implemented in previous versions of kSynth), pitch shift (also already implemented), and master volume.</p>  <p>Stay tuned.</p></div>
