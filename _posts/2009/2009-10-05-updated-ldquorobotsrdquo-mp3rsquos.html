title: "Updated &amp;ldquo;Robots&amp;rdquo; mp3&amp;rsquo;s"
---

<p>Earlier this weekend when I posted my <a href="http://hodsaudio.net/Album/Details/12" target="_blank"><em>Robots Stole My Computer</em></a> compilation, I realized I didn't have all of the ID3 tag information set on the mp3's in that collection.  The ID3 tag data has now been updated to include all the appropriate artist, song title, and album title information.  Feel free to re-download if this is important to you.  </p>  <div id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:93d5fe65-9a12-481f-a380-9653d28d8680" class="tags">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/music" rel="tag">music</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/mp3" rel="tag">mp3</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/id3" rel="tag">id3</a></div>
