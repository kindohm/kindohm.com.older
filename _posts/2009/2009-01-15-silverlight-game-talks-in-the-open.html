title: "Silverlight Game Talks In the Open"
---

<p> There are a few things coming up in the near future with respect to the game development I've been doing with Silverlight:</p> <ul> <li>1/20/2009 - I'll be presenting a 15-minute talk at the Twin Cities Silverlight User Group on my <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/tanks" target="_blank">TANKS</a> Silverlight game.  The user group that day is doing a showcase on a number of Silverlight apps, and I'll be one of a number of presenters.</li> <li>1/20/2009 - I'll be recording a <a href="http://www.slickthought.net/category/SpaghettiCode.aspx" target="_blank">Spaghetti Code podcast</a> where I'll be discussing the development and learning experiences of the TANKS game with Jeff Brand.  </li> <li>4/4/2009 - I'm presenting at the sixth Twin Cities Code Camp.  My topic will be "Build a Game with Silverlight and the Farseer Physics Engine".  As much as practical, I'll be developing a game from scratch in front of the audience.  I'm sure I'll have a big OhCrap.txt file standing by :)</li></ul> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:01ee03b4-7658-4fdc-bfe0-30b87a389e72">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/code" rel="tag">code</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/silverlight" rel="tag">silverlight</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/podcast" rel="tag">podcast</a></div>
