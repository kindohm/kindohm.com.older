title: "kSynth.b &amp;ndash; a new Silverlight Synthesizer/Sequencer"
---

<p>I just completed work on another Silverlight audio project that I've named <strong><em>kSynth.b</em></strong>.  A short while back I released <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2009/07/29/released-ksynth-ndash-a-silverlight-audio-synthesizer.aspx">kSynth</a>.  kSynth.b isn't really a <em>new version</em> of kSynth - it's just something a little different.</p>

<p>Here is a screen shot: </p>

<p>Some of the unique features of the app include:</p>
  
<ol>   
<li>Polyphony (you can play more than one note at the same time) </li>    
<li>A drum sequencer that plays wave file drum samples.  Four drum sample libraries to choose from. </li>    
<li>Scrollable 7-octave synthesizer/sequencer grid. </li>    
<li>Sequencer grid sizeable from 4 to 128 16th notes. </li>    
<li>Adjustable tempo from 1 to 2500 bpm. </li>    
<li>A variety of synth parameters to control the sound: Funkage, Spacicity, Sauce, Tunage, Attack, Release, Delay, and Grain. </li> 
</ol>  
<p>You may wonder why parameters named "Funkage", "Spacicity", and "Sauce" are used.  The main reason is that there are four underlying oscillators that generate the synth sounds.  There are enough parameters per oscillator that allowing the user to control every parameter for each oscillator would be just too much to present on the screen - and it'd be confusing.  The point of the app wasn't to allow users to make granular oscillator tweaks but instead to have fun making cool (or annoying) sounds.  You can read more about how these parameters work on <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/ksynth.b/help.htm">the help page</a>.</p>
  
<p>Adding wave file playback support was pretty easy to do.  It's just like playing a sine wave, except the logic used to determine what data gets written to the media stream is a little different.  Instead of performing sine wave calculations, you sequentially read through a byte array.</p>
  
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge of this app was creating a polyphonic sequencer that performed well.  I started out creating a sequencer per pitch, but it was not a good approach as the number of pitches got large (7 octaves x 12 pitches per octave = 84 sequencers).  I refactored the sequencer code so that it could handle any number of pitches with just a single sequencer.  </p>
  
<p>kSynth.b can run on your desktop without an internet connection.  I enabled Silverlight's "out of browser/sandboxed" capabilities that allow the user to right-click on the app and install it to their desktop.  </p>
  
<p>The "out of browser" capability leads to some interesting possibilities with using kSynth.b as an instrument.  While kSynth.b does not support the ability to pipe audio data to disk, audio app, or VST plugin, you <em>can</em> use your computer's audio output to play or send kSynth.b audio through a speaker system or as an analog signal to some other device.  I'm doubtful anyone would use kSynth.b for this purpose, but if any folks out there end up using kSynth.b for some ambient background music or for some other performance I'd love to hear about it!</p>
