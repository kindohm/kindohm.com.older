title: "TANKS Game Featured in TCS Weekly Episode 1"
---

<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/TCSWeekly/" target="_blank">TCS Weekly</a> is a new video show on MSDN Channel 9.  The <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/tanks" target="_blank">TANKS</a> game is featured in its inaugural episode alongside other features such as Windows 7 beta, Silverlight controls source code, Live Mesh, and Moonlight on Linux.  That is some pretty good company!  I'm flattered that TANKS was chosen for the video.  It's a very brief feature, but that is the nature of the demos in the video.  </p> <p>You can watch the first episode here:</p> <p><a title="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/TCSWeekly/TCSWeekly001/" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/TCSWeekly/TCSWeekly001/">http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/TCSWeekly/TCSWeekly001/</a></p> <div class="tags" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:bfc2303e-b9f3-4fa3-bbad-55081b5165b1">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/silverlight" rel="tag">silverlight</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/code" rel="tag">code</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/channel9" rel="tag">channel9</a></div>
