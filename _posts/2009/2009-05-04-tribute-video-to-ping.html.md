title: "Tribute Video to Ping"
---

<p>We are down one cat at our house.  We had to give up our cat Ping because of the massive pee problem she had around the house.  It was a tough but necessary decision.</p>
  
<p>I will salute Ping here with a music video in which she gets a lot of camera time.  It's an older music video I made long ago.  She's the orange/tan cat.</p>
