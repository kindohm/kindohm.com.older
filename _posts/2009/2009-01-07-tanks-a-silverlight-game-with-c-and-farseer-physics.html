title: "TANKS - a Silverlight Game with C# and Farseer Physics"
---

<p>I introduce to you <em>TANKS</em> - a web-based game built on Silverlight with C# and the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/farseerphysics" target="_blank">Farseer Physics engine</a>:</p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/tanks">http://www.kindohm.com/tanks</a></p> <p>Here are a few screen shots:</p> <p><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/TANKSaSilverlightGamewithCandFarseerPhys_7272/screen1.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="230" alt="screen1" src="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/TANKSaSilverlightGamewithCandFarseerPhys_7272/screen1_thumb.png" width="304" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/TANKSaSilverlightGamewithCandFarseerPhys_7272/screen2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="229" alt="screen2" src="http://www.kindohm.com/LocalImages/Posts/TANKSaSilverlightGamewithCandFarseerPhys_7272/screen2_thumb.png" width="304" border="0" /></a> </p> <p>Some highlights and facts of the game:</p> <ul> <li>Single player, real-time.  The enemies shoot at you while you shoot at them.  </li><li>You score points by making hits and kills.  You get more points for shooting efficiently and flipping over enemies.  </li><li>You can shoot down powerups and increase your ability to destroy enemies or stay alive.  Powerups stay with you as you progress through the game.  </li><li>The game has an infinite number of rounds.  Each round is incrementally more difficult.  </li><li>There are eight unique "maps" or terrains.  </li><li>Three weapons exist in the game: cannon (default), Uzi, and Llama Gun.  The Uzi and Llama Gun are obtained via powerups.  </li><li>Wind affects your shots.  Strong winds blow your projectiles around.  </li><li>You can submit your score at the end of the game.  View high scores at <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/tanks/stats.htm">http://www.kindohm.com/tanks/stats.htm</a>.  </li><li>Runs in any browser that supports Silverlight (if you're a developer then you already know this) </li><li>The game is a 600KB+ download :(  You'll need to be patient for a few seconds while the Silverlight .xap file downloads.</li></ul> <p>More details about release history, known bugs, and all other details are available from <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/tanks">http://www.kindohm.com/tanks</a>.  </p> <p>At this point I have no plans to develop the game any further except to fix any bugs that keep people from enjoying the game.  A colleague suggested a plug-in architecture for enemy AI, which wouldn't be too difficult to support and would be really cool, but at this point I just can't invest any more time into this game.  </p> <p>Your feedback about the game is welcomed.
