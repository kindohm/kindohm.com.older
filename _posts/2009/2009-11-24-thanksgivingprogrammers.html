title: "Thanksgiving Foods and Computer Programmers"
---

<div><p>As a software developer, what is your favorite thanksgiving food?  It is a little-known fact that the dish you crave the most in late November tells a lot about you and your computer programming personality.</p>  <h3>Turkey</h3>  <p>As a turkey-loving programmer, you work faster and get more done than anybody else on your team.  You quickly crank out features and leave the rest of the team in the dust.  The problem is that you cut corners and leave a wake of bugs and problems for the rest of the team to sweep up.  You don&#8217;t test your work.  You implement features that weren&#8217;t asked for.  And you certainly don&#8217;t use source control.</p>  <h3>Mashed Potatoes</h3>  <p>You crave mashed potatoes on the Thanksgiving table - and you are an old school, grizzled veteran who does everything the old fashioned way.  Self-documenting code?  Never heard of it. That fancy ORM library that&#8217;s been out for a few years?  No way you&#8217;ll use it.  Despite your unwillingness to embrace anything that hasn&#8217;t been in a stable release for a few years, you write amazingly solid code and your features work 100% of the time.</p>  <h3>Stuffing</h3>  <p>You love the stuffing, and you sure know a lot about software development.  For hours on end you utter complete paragraphs filled with nothing but programming buzz-words.  Dependency injection. Mocking. ORM. Model-view-view-controller-view-model-model-controller-view.  You fill up entire whiteboards with hypothetical architectures and new software designs that will save your development team months of time and lots of money.  However, being a salty bread-crumb-eating programmer, you write about 10% as much code as anyone else on the team.</p>  <h3>Cranberry Sauce</h3>  <p>You don&#8217;t like to admit it, but cranberry sauce is what you secretly enjoy the most at Thanksgiving.  And back at work you secretly get an unbelieavable amount of work done and everything you touch is a success. The problem is that you touch everything. That bug your co-worker has been looking at for the past two weeks?  You fixed it last night.  That reporting tool in the app your team didn&#8217;t have time for?  You checked in that code over the weekend. You also decided to replace a few screens your other co-worker has been working on because you could do it better.</p>  <h3>Pumpkin Pie</h3>  <p>You like the pumpkin pie, and you know when good enough is good enough.  You strive to produce some of the worst code on your projects in as much time as possible.  Maybe it&#8217;s job security, maybe it&#8217;s laziness.  The bugs you produce in your code give you a reason to come in the next day for a paycheck.  Nobody really wants to give you a challenging feature on the app, and you&#8217;re ok with that.</p></div>
