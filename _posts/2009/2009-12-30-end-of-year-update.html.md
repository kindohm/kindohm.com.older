title: "End of Year Update"

<p>I&#8217;m halfway through my time off from work and I haven&#8217;t done a single thing I planned on when the break started.  Oh well - such is the life of a person with too many hobbies.</p>














  
<p>We were up in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=duluth,+mn&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=58.72842,135.263672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Duluth,+St.+Louis,+Minnesota&amp;t=h&amp;z=11" target="_blank">Duluth, MN</a> for the Christmas holiday.  They got 26 inches of snow on Dec. 24th and 25th.  We stayed at my parents&#8217; place, and my dad&#8217;s snowblower broke while we were there.  My dad and I got our fill of shoveling.</p>














  
<p>I&#8217;m working on two apps to submit for the <a href="http://mix10k.visitmix.com/" target="_blank">MIX10&#160;10k Coding Challenge</a>. One is &#8220;Twitter Synth&#8221; - a Silverlight app that plays Twitter search results as music, and &#8220;Off the Air&#8221;, which is kind of like a scaled down version of <a href="http://kindohm.com/kSynth.Drone" target="_blank">kSynth.Drone</a> with a visual twist.  Most of the work for these was done before the break but I&#8217;ve put a few final touches on each one.  I plan on releasing both of these apps very soon.</p>














  
<p>I&#8217;m nearing the completion of a five-song musical saga (in the Rock genre, if I had to peg it) about a hostile takeover by robots. Trust me, it&#8217;s very dramatic. I&#8217;ll post the lyrics later when the work is done. All I have left is to record the vocals for the five songs. I wanted to get the vocals done during my break from work but that hasn&#8217;t happened. These songs will be released on <a href="http://hodsaudio.net" target="_blank">HodsAudio.net</a> and I won&#8217;t attempt to burn or press any of these songs to physical media like I have in the past.  After this project is done, I&#8217;m hoping to make some breakcore-style remixes from the original tracks.</p>














  
<p>Nikki and I were fortunate to receive a Rock Band 2 drum kit as a Christmas gift. Rock Band 2 is kind of an old game but it&#8217;s still a fun game to us.  Before we just played on a couple of guitar controllers, but now we have the new drum kit to keep it interesting. I&#8217;ve been busy trying to get 100% of the notes on Metallica&#8217;s &#8220;Battery&#8221; on Expert.  I&#8217;m at 97% so far :)  Unfortunately, the Rock Band game&#8217;s &#8220;looseness&#8221; on note accuracy doesn&#8217;t translate well to real drumset playing.</p>














  
<p>So for 2010&#8230;.  I have no plans whatsoever other than a family vacation in the spring.  I&#8217;ll keep making music and writing code and hope to keep traveling and do some camping.</p>














  
<p>Here&#8217;s to a great 2010!</p>
