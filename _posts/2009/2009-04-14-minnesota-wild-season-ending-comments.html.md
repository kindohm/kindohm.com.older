In some ways, the Wild's season was close to <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/0001/01/01/minnesota-wild-2008-2009-predictions.aspx" target="_blank">what I predicted at the beginning of the season</a>.  In other ways, it wasn't even close.  </p>
  
<p>At the beginning of the season, I thought that the departure of Pavol Demitra and Brian Rolston would be a wash with the addition of Andrew Brunette and the improved play of the Wild's younger talent like Mikko Koivu, Brent Burns, and James Sheppard.  If you look at the raw stats for Demitra, Rolston, Brunette, and Koivu for the season [1], I think it all evened out.  Where the Wild really lost ground this year is with Gaborik, who sat out most of the season and played a whopping 17 games [2].  If you extrapolate his 13 goals scored in 17 games, he was on pace to score 62 goals this year.  The Wild scored 6 fewer goals this year compared with last season [3].  For an entire 82-game season, that isn't much of a loss.  With a healthy Gaborik I believe the Wild would have made the playoffs easily this season.  Losing Demitra and Rolston were non-issues.</p>
  
<p>So what is in store for the future?  </p>
  
<p>I'll start with Marian Gaborik.  I wrote a while back that he has yet to prove that he is a superstar player: <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/0001/01/01/gaboriks-days-are-numbered.aspx">gaboriks-days-are-numbered.aspx</a>.  He's either moody or injured.  Always.  There is a serious soap opera drama yet to be played out between Gaborik and the Minnesota franchise this offseason.  He is an unrestricted free agent and he has great potential to score goals.  It's just a question of what the Wild will do to convince Gaborik to stay, and whether other teams will gamble on his health history.  </p>
  
<p>Personally I think the Wild should keep Gaborik.  I'll take the gamble on his health.  He keeps fans coming back to the arena.  He's good for the team.  He has some attitude, but what teams don't have players with an attitude?  </p>
  
<p>Perhaps the biggest factor with the team that I have yet to bring up is the departure of Jacques Lemaire as coach.  Rumors are that there was a lot of friction between Lemaire and the team in the locker room.  Lemaire decided to step down because the team needed a change.  Sounds like he fell on his sword so that the players would play better in the future.  Maybe Jacque's absence is motivation for Gaborik to stay.  </p>
  
<p>Minnesota has a few priorities this offseason: sign key free agents [4] (Gaborik, Martin Skoula, Marc-Andre Bergeron, Kurtis Foster, and Josh Harding), and sign a worthwhile free agent.  If you look at the core team (including upcoming free agents), we've got some outstanding talent: Koivu, Gaborik, Brunette, Nolan, Clutterbuck, Burns, Bergeron, Backstrom...  It's a matter of getting the team to play every night - hrm, I'm sounding like Lemaire.  But if we can sign a new free agent who can deliver just a little more offense then I think that the Wild would be an automatic contender for the Stanley Cup in the postseason next year.</p>
  
<p>When all is said and done, I'll be showing up at the games next year to cheer on the team and I hope they do well no matter what they choose to do in the offseason.  But I think the team is at a defining point in their history with the departure of the coach and the possibility of losing Gaborik.  It's possible we may not see the team in the postseason for a few years if the wrong moves are made.  </p>
