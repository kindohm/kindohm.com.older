title: "What?! You still haven&amp;rsquo;t signed up for the next Twin Cities Code Camp?"

<p>The Twin Cities Code Camp is an outstanding event that happens twice each year (sounds like a line from a holiday jingle or something...).  What makes these events so great?</p>
  
<p><strong>Code Camps are FREE!</strong> [1]</p>
  
<p>The next Twin Cities Code Camp will be tomorrow on April 4th, 2009, held at the University of Minnesota's Computer Science and Engineering building.  All of the event information you need can be found here:</p>

<p>The breadth of programming topics in this code camp is extremely wide...  perhaps the most diverse I've ever seen.  It's 25 sessions of code, code, code!  No vendors slamming a marketing message into your face.  Just programmers showing you sweet, sweet code.  And the best part is...</p>
  
<p><strong>Code Camps are FREE!</strong></p>
  
<p>The venue for the TCCC changed this year to the U of M, and I wanted to double check and make sure that breakfast and lunch would still be provided to attendees.  So, I decided to ask the originator and organizer of the TCCC, Jason Bock, and had the following chat with the legend himself:</p>
  
<pre style="font-family: courier new, monospace; overflow: visible;">hods says:    will lunch be provided tomorrow?    (just getting some facts straight for a blog post) Jason Bock   says:    not for you hods says:    what about for everyone else Jason Bock   says:    [...] yes, lunch is provided    continental breaky    it's all on the schedule</pre>  
<p>So there you have it...</p>
  
<p><strong>Code Camps are FREE!</strong></p>
  
<p><strong>Twin Cities Code Camps have FREE LUNCH!</strong></p>
  
<p>Well, <em>somebody</em> is paying the bill - there are many generous donors and sponsors for the event.  Included in the donations are prize giveaways!  In the past - gaming systems, books, and software licenses have been handed out.  Nice!  I have been assured that this code camp will live up to past expectations in the prize department.  </p>
  
<p>So, to reiterate:</p>
  
<p><strong>Code Camps are FREE!</strong></p>
  
<p><strong>Twin Cities Code Camps have FREE LUNCH!</strong></p>
  
<p><strong>Twin Cities Code Camps give out PRIZES!</strong></p>
