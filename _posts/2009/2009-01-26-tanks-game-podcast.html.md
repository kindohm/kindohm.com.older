The interview discusses the use of the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/farseerphysics" target="_blank">Farseer Physics</a> engine, game AI, game UI, and lessons learned during development.  </p>

<p>Thanks to Jeff for setting everything up and producing the podcast!</p>
<p>Since I'm on the topic of TANKS - I've begun working on TANKS v2 (which will probably be renamed to TURRETS).  After viewing some other physics-based Silverlight games out in the wild such as <a href="http://www.physicspoweredgames.com/Games/Diver/Diver.aspx" target="_blank">Diver</a>, I've become motivated to create a much cleaner, polished game.  I aim to do that with TURRETS.  Development for TURRETS is well under way but is far from done.  TURRETS utilizes some background threads for screen loading, better screen management, and (hopefully) a cleaner game UI.</p>
