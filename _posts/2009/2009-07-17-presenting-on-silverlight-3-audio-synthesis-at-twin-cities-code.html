title: "Presenting on Silverlight 3 Audio Synthesis at Twin Cities Code Camp"
---

<p>I submitted my topic yesterday for  the next Twin Cities Code Camp, which will be held on 10/24/2009 at the University of Minnesota.  Details and registration info are at <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com">www.twincitiescodecamp.com</a>.  </p>
<p>My topic is <em>Audio Synthesis with Silverlight 3</em>.  Here's the session description:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px"><em>Silverlight 3 offers new power to developers in being able to work with raw WAV audio. In this code-heavy session you will see how to produce raw sound wave forms, work with the sound buffer, and send audio to Silverlight 3. We'll cover topics such as sequencing, blending, peaks, panning, and how to generate a considerable amount of annoying noise through your web browser to irritate co-workers. </em></p>
<p>Final selections for sessions has yet to take place.  I can't guarantee my topic will be selected.</p>
<p>I have a thing or two to learn about this topic before I present it.  I have a few cool app ideas that would be fun to present at the session, if I can get them ready in time.  </p>
