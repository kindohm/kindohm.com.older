This particular piece is complete with phasing stereo sawtooth synths and drum loops.</p>  <p>There is some silence at the beginning of the audio - please be patient :)</p>  <p>You can also download the mp3 here: <a href="http://kindohm.com/files/kSynth.b.demo.mp3" target="_blank">http://kindohm.com/files/kSynth.b.demo.mp3</a></p>  <p>Enjoy.</p>
