<div><p>It&#8217;s late on a week night, I really need sleep, and what am I doing? That&#8217;s right -  I'm completely overhauling my internet presence.</p> <p>Welcome to <a title="hodnick.com" href="http://hodnick.com" target="_blank">hodnick.com</a>,  my new web home.</p> <p>First off, my RSS feed is still at the same Feedburner location, so your RSS reader should pick this  major change up just fine. For those of you keeping score, the Feedburner url is  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/kindohm" target="_blank">http://feeds.feedburner.com/kindohm</a>.</p> <p>Now, why have I made this change? Kindohm.com hasn&#8217;t gone away - it&#8217;s just not going to host \ my &#8220;blog&#8221; any more. Kindohm.com still hosts all of my old blog content for the time being.  The main reason for this is so that permalinks to old posts don&#8217;t break and so that Google and all those old articles can still be friends.</p> <p>Why am I moving my blog to hodnick.com?  The main reason is blog/content management software.  Kindohm.com uses the <a title="Subtext" target="_blank" href="http://www.subtextproject.com">Subtext</a> ASP.NET blog engine, and I just don&#8217;t want to use it any more.  It&#8217;s an outstanding application but it just doesn&#8217;t have the support and flexibility I&#8217;m looking for.  Plus the app dominates my domain in an ASP.NET sense.  Getting custom ASP.NET web apps to run in sub-directories is a challenge sometimes.</p> <p>Hodnick.com is running on <a title="Tubmlr" target="_blank" href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>.</p> <p>Someday, I&#8217;ll probably remove the Subtext app entirely from kindohm.com.  <a title="Jake" target="_blank" href="http://thoughtstoblog.com">Jake</a> suggested generating static, archived content from the Subtext database to keep the old article urls intact.  I&#8217;ll tackle that at some point&#8230;</p> <p>If you view the new landing page of kindohm.com (<a title="http://www.kindohm.com" target="_blank" href="http://www.kindohm.com"><a href="http://www.kindohm.com" target="_blank">http://www.kindohm.com</a></a>) you&#8217;ll see a little bit of information on kindohm.com&#8217;s new purpose.  It&#8217;s really going to be my app server from now on where I&#8217;ll dump code and apps.</p> <p>That about brings you up to speed.  Hopefully nobody will get lost in the process.  There are a few quirky remnants hanging around from when I started my Tumblr account originally, and those items will probably sneak in to the RSS feed.  Sorry for that :)</p></div>
