title: "Tribute Video to Ping"
---

<p>We are down one cat at our house.  We had to give up our cat Ping because of the massive pee problem she had around the house.  It was a tough but necessary decision.</p>  <p>I will salute Ping here with a music video in which she gets a lot of camera time.  It's an older music video I made long ago.  She's the orange/tan cat.</p>  <br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/r959FX-lBMc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/r959FX-lBMc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344" /></object>  <br />  <br />  <div id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:fb26a2f9-2a66-41f3-9ae9-f3500f21a87b" class="tags">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/cat" rel="tag">cat</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/video" rel="tag">video</a></div>
