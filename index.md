		<p>Live Coded audio is a new direction in electronic music and video 
			that is growing in popularity in the UK and is emerging in the 
			states.</p>

		<p>In Live Coded music, hybrid programmer-musicians write computer code 
			in real-time that generates improvised music and visuals while the 
			raw data is projected on a projection screen for the audience to 
			see.</p> 

		<p>Rebuffing trends in pre-programmed electronic music and turn-key 
			computer DJ software, Live Coding embraces transparency, 
			improvisation and a raw, genuine, hands-on approach to composition 
			and performance. The result is a symbiotic connection between 
			musician, audience and code that is truly pushing the boundaries 
			of how we create, enjoy and share music in our computer-centric 
			culture.</p>

		<p>Minneapolis musician and software developer Mike Hodnick 
			(a.k.a. Kindohm) is leading an effort to introduce Live Coding to 
			U.S. audiences through exhibition performances at experimental 
			music festivals, art shows and hackathons. </p>
