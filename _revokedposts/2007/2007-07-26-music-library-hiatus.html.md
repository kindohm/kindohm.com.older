title: "Music Library Hiatus"
---

<p>My music library (<a href="http://www.kindohm.com/musiclibrary">www.kindohm.com/musiclibrary</a>) is back online after a multi-week period of downtime.  The downtime was caused by my last <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> upgrade and I just chose to ignore the problem until today. </p>
<p>That being said, there are a few nuggets of musical goodness I stumbled across recently on my old music computer.  I hope to upload them soon.</p>
