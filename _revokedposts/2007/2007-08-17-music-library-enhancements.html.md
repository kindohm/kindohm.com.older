title: "Music Library Enhancements"
---

<p><img style="margin: 5px" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1322/1148900726_2f1d1cfdde_m.jpg" align="right" />Recently I've been working on some enhancements to my <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/musiclibrary">music library</a> and deployed the changes early this morning. I also re-styled it just for fun - and kind of used my latest blog skin as a base.</p>
<p>The new features in the music library include:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Mike's Favorite Tunes  </li>
<li>Ten Latest Tunes  </li>
<li>A more compact "tag cloud" showing top tags  </li>
<li>New layout, including a side bar with search, top tags, and favorite/latest song lists </li></ul> 
<p>I also upgraded the app to ASP .Net 2.0 and incorporated a master page.  </p>
<p>The next thing I'd like to work on some day is a user rating system where anyone could rate a song or album (e.g. 1-to-5 scale or something). I'm not sure that I'd want to allow anonymous users to do that though, and I'm also not sure that I want to maintain a membership database. </p>
