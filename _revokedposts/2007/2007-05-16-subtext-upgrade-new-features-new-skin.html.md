title: "Subtext Upgrade, New Features, New Skin"
---

<p>Tonight, at random, I decided to upgrade my site and create a new design for it.  It's 12:30 AM and it's done.  No it's not.  I'm kidding.</p>
  
<p>The latest release of <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> now supports tagging and identicons.  Subtext uses a microformat for tagging, and I actually haven't quite figured out how to best integrate Subtext tagging in my site yet.  It just doesn't work as cleanly as I'd like.  </p>
