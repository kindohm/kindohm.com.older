title: "Chicago Getaway"
---

<p>Nikki and I will be vacationing in Chicago in mid-March.  We just booked our hotel a few days ago.  We don't have any specific plans other than the hotel, and we're looking forward to five days of goofing off.  We're going over St. Patrick's Day weekend, so we might take in the parade and whatever other St. Patrick's Day-type things Chicago has to offer.</p>

<p>Nikki's mom will be watching Eva while we're gone.  This'll be the 2nd time that Eva's stayed with grandma for an extended time.  Last time she did great, and hopefully she'll have fun with the grandparents again this time.</p>
  
<p>We had a hard time deciding what to do for a trip this year.  We talked about a Caribbean resort, Mexican resort, Colorado ski trip, and Lutsen ski trip before deciding to make a drive to Chicago.  Why would we decide to go to Chicago over the Caribbean or a ski resort?   Easy: Lake Michigan.  </p>
