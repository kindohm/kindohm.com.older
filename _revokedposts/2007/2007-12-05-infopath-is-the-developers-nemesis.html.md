title: "InfoPath is the developer&#39;s nemesis"

<p><a title="Happy Man by kindohm, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/2089182296/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 5px" height="180" alt="Happy Man" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2383/2089182296_f46e47bdbe_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></a>Today I need to face the fact that InfoPath is MS Access's evil stepchild. InfoPath is just a new version of MS Access with a new front end and a new back end. </p>
<p>But seriously, on this current project I'm on, InfoPath is basically being used as a front-end for SQL data.  The kicker requirement is that we can't use InfoPath's "code behind" capabilities or any other "custom code" to accomplish moving the data from InfoPath to SQL.  The result is one big XML and XSD parser.  XPath and I are going to become really good friends for the next three months.  I don't know that XPath realizes it yet though.  </p>
<p>In fact, I think I saw XPath and InfoPath talking together this morning as I walked in to the office.  They were conspiring to kidnap both me and SQL, throw us into the trunk of their 1997 Taurus, then proceed to drive to Tofte where they will leave a ransom note before heading off to Winnipeg.  They'll tie us down on chairs in an old log cabin as they feed unstructured, random data that they need to report on.</p>
<p>Somebody poke me.</p>
