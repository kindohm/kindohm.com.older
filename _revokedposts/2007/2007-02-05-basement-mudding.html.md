title: "Basement Mudding"
---

<p>The contractors will be here this week to mud and complete the finish coats on the walls.  They were ahead of schedule last week so I'm guessing they could be done as early as Wednesday, otherwise they were estimating they'd be done on Friday.</p>
  
<p>I can't help but walk down in the basement a few times a day just to look at it - even if I don't have a reason to.  It's pretty exciting to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/sets/72157594512745612/" target="_blank">see progress being made</a>.</p>
