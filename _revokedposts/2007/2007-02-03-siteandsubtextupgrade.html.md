title: "Site and SubText Upgrade"
---

<p>I may be brave and attempt to upgrade my site to the latest version of <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a>. It'll involve an upgrade to ASP .Net 2.0, a database schema change, and some web.config merging. With luck, there'll be little downtime. At worst, I won't get a good chance to fix any major problems until Tuesday if I run into anything I can't solve tonight. </p>
<p>The change will also coincide with a new site skin, which is <em>not</em> the same as <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2006/11/07/NewSiteSkin.aspx">this new skin that I previewed before</a>. I ended up hating that design :)</p>
