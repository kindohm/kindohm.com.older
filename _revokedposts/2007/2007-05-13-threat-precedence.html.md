<p>I've whipped out yet another new tune.  I was thinking of how to describe this one, and all I could think of was this: imagine graphing a quadratic function on a TI-95 calculator, throwing the calculator into a garbage disposal and obliterating it while fending off someone attacking you with a knife.   </p>
