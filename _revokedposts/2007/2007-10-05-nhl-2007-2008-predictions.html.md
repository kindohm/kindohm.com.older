title: "NHL 2007-2008 Predictions"
---

<p>This is going to be brief (versus an in-depth analysis of teams, rosters, etc), and if anything it's mainly for fun when I look back next April at what I predicted.</p>
<p>I don't think much will change in the Western Conference this year.  In the Northwest, the Wild, Calgary, and Vancouver will make the playoffs.  Detroit, Anaheim, San Jose, Nashville, and Dallas will fill in the rest of the West for the playoffs.  I'll say that Detroit and Anaheim will face each other in the finals, and Anaheim will advance.</p>
<p>In the East, who knows.  I barely pay attention to the East.  I'd bet on Ottawa being on the top, with New Jersey and New York Rangers close behind.  Buffalo has lost Drury to the Rangers, which I think will be significant.  I'm eager to see if Atlanta will be able to build on their talented, youthful roster that carried them to the first round of the playoffs last season.  Ottawa and the Rangers will square off in the conference finals, and the Rangers will advance.  Yes, New York finally has their act together.</p>
<p>Anaheim wins the Cup finals by default because they'll just beat up whichever team they face.  </p>
<p>See you in April.</p>
