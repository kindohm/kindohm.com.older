title: "Barreiro on religion in society"
---

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kfan.com/pages/barreiro/index.html">Dan Barreiro</a> of KFAN spoke last week about the the saddening fact (based on a Gallup poll) that more than half of people [1] would not vote for a non-religious candidate in an election. Barreiro suggests that it is discrimination - what would happen if more than half of people wouldn't vote for an African-American or Latino candidate? Choosing to vote for a candidate based on religion is prejudice, and shouldn't our U.S. constitution protect non-believers from this? What difference does a candidate's faith (or lack of it) make when morals, values, and their ability to lead transcend religion?</p>
<p>Here's Barreiro's broadcast on the issue. The topic begins at about nine minutes in: <a href="http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/MINNEAPOLIS-MN/KFAN-AM/BAR030207_religion.mp3">BAR030207_religion.mp3</a></p>
  
<p>[1] I don't know specifics about the Gallup poll and I don't know what population was "sampled".  All I can cite is Barreiro's broadcast.</p>
