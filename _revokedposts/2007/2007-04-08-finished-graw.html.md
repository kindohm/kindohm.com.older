title: "Finished GRAW"
---

<p>I just finished <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graw" target="_blank">Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter</a> last night.  Add this to the extremely short list of video games I've actually finished.  It was a hell of a game and I'd play it all again.  The last mission in the game was pretty awesome - a very violent shootout with heavy weapons in downtown Mexico City.  It reminded me a lot of the shootout scene in the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_(movie)" target="_blank">Heat</a> (Pacino, De Niro).  </p>
  
<p>This might be the best game I've ever played.  A while back I blogged about how I hope <a href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Bungie</a> in corporates some of GRAW's features like taking cover, aiming, etc into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3" target="_blank">H3</a>.  However I realized that H3 is a first-person shooter and GRAW is a third-person shooter.  I don't think a lot of the stuff would really cross over very well.  At least H3 will have the Mongoose :)</p>
  
<p>You gamers out there are probably laughing at me, because GRAW is <em>old</em>.  That's just how it is :)  The sequel to this game is already out and I'll plan on buying it someday.  But right now, I have to tackle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_war" target="_blank">Gears of War</a> next.  Something tells me I'll still be playing it by the time H3 is out.</p>
