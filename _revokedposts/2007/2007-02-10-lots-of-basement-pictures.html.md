<p><a title="Photo Sharing" target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/385022072/"><img style="MARGIN: 3px" height="180" align="right" alt="Bare basement before the project #1" width="240" border="0" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/179/385022072_ca15994282_m.jpg" /></a>I uploaded quite a few of the pictures we have of the basement remodeling project up to Flickr, so now there's a more complete history of what the project has looked like - from bare concrete walls to sanded drywall. You can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/sets/72157594512745612/">view the entire photo set here</a>. It's crazy to think that the whole space used to be bare.</p>
<p>Today the contractors did their final steps and the drywall work is 100% complete. Now I need to clean up a ridiculous amount of dust. Next we're moving on to paint, doors, and flooring. It feels very odd to be thinking about those things now... they used to feel like unreachable parts of the project. </p>
