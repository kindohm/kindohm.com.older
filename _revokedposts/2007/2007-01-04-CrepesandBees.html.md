<p>This is nothing more than an obligatory "Gee I haven't posted anything here in a long time" post.  Things have been busy.  And there's been some stuff too.  Ramble ramble ramble, butter, butter, mule.  So we finally got snow.  That took forever.  The Wild are on a 3-game win streak.  Hopefully they've turned a corner.  We're going to the Wild vs. Tampa game tonight.  Go goals score pucks.  </p>
  
<p>Work has been a blast.  We're doing crazy stuff non-stop with IW tech.  Nothing like living your life in undocumented tech.  Word.</p>
  
<p><a href="http://www.jasonbock.net">Jason</a> and I are making progress on our music project.  Vocals remain, and that's on my shoulders.  It'll get done this month.  Stoked and stuff.  Word.  I'm eager to get the basement done and keep recording more stuff.  </p>
  
<p><a href="http://www.evajoy.net">Eva's</a> doing great.  She's been kinda sick off and on for the past month but she's in great spirits and is doing all kinds of new stuff.  Every day she's learning something new or saying something new.  Humans are fascinating, aren't they? </p>
  
<p>Hail 2007.  My new year started in May though.  That's when I make my resolutions.  Just easier that way.  Stuff.  Things.</p>
