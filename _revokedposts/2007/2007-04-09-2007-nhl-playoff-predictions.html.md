<p>The NHL playoffs are finally here.  Here are my 2007 NHL Playoff predictions:</p>
  
<p><strong>Western Conference</strong></p>
<ul>   
<li>Detroit (1) vs. Calgary (8).  Detroit will win in 5 games.  Calgary has a lot of heart but Detroit has so much damn skill it's scary.  How can you lose with Zetterberg and Datsyuk?  Plus their 75-year-old goaltender (Hasek) is still awesome.  </li>   
<li>Anaheim (2) vs. Minnesota (7).  The Wild will win in 7 games.  I'm picking the Wild only because I'm a fanboy, and these teams split their regular season series 50/50.  </li>   
<li>Vancouver (3) vs. Dallas (6).  Dallas finished the season with more points than Vancouver even though Vancouver is seeded higher.  Both teams have great goaltending.  Vancouver will win in 7 games.</li>   
<li>Nashville (4) vs. San Jose (5).  I really liked Nashville until they traded for academy award-winning Peter Forsberg.  It's time for both of these teams wo win the Cup.  They've both been building and building for years and have great teams.  I know the Wild can beat the Sharks, so I'll say Nashville in 6 games.</li> </ul>  
<p>In the semis, we'll see Detroit beat the Wild in 5 games, and Nashville will beat Vancouver in 5 games.  Nashville will go to the finals.</p>
  
<p><strong>Eastern Conference</strong></p>
<ul>   
<li>Buffalo (1) vs. NY Islanders (8).  The Islanders just squeezed into the playoffs on the last day of the season.  Buffalo is a juggernaut.  Buffalo will sweep in 4 games.</li>   
<li>New Jersey (2) vs. Tampa Bay (7).  New Jersey still has a super-human goaltender and Tampa has a tiny point total.  Tampa also has the highest goals-against total of all playoff teams.  New Jersey in 5 games.</li>   
<li>Atlanta (3) vs. NY Rangers (6).  I'll give the edge to the Rangers because Atlanta will rely more on skill than heart and tough play.  Rangers in 6 games.</li>   
<li>Ottawa (4) vs. Pittsburgh (5).  Pittsburgh has the 2nd-highest total of goals against of all playoff teams.  Like Atlanta, their skill only take them so far.  Ottawa in 6 games. </li></ul>   
<p>In the semis, Buffalo will beat the Rangers in 5 games, and New Jersey will beat Ottawa in 7.  Buffalo will beat New Jersey to go to the finals because they have grit and an insane ability to score goals - as long as they can solve Martin Brodeur.  Buffalo wins in 7 games.</p>
  
<p>In the finals we'll see Buffalo and Nashville.  Buffalo will win in 5 games.</p>
