<p>That's right.  I finally found one of these:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/540483564/" title="Photo Sharing"><img border="0" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1308/540483564_cb951506a5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Zildjian Swish Cymbal" /></a></p>
  
<p>I've been looking for one of these for a long, long time.  Zildjian doesn't make them any more, and they've been hard to come by on eBay.  I ended up winning one in an eBay auction yesterday.  It's used and according to the picture it looks like it was taped up at one time, but it was also half the price of a new one.  I just hope it sounds close to my old/current/cracked one.</p>
