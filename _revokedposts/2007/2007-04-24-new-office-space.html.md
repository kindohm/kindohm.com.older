title: "New Office Space"
---

<p>My employer is moving to a new office, tenantively slated around June 1.  Today we had the chance to go over and look at the new space (it's a building right next to ours) and it's going to be awesome.  In our current space we are literally overflowing with people.  In my area we don't have assigned seating, and we're getting to the point where if you don't get in early you might not have a spot to sit.  The new space is a lot larger (we'll have room to grow a bit) and in person it looked a lot larger than what I've seen on paper.  </p>

<p>I can't imagine being responsible for constructing a new office.  There are so many opinions from so many people and you just can't make everbody happy.  I think that our planners have done a good job though.  There will be some really nice amenities in the new space for employees to collaborate in and relax.  One of the things I'm really looking forward to are windows and fewer walls.  Today, where I sit I can't see any natural light.  In the new space where the developers sit the floor is open and the natural light will come in.  In addition, we'll be up on the 3rd floor and that'll be kinda fun.  I've always been on a ground floor wherever I've worked. </p>
  
<p>Most importantly, our foos table is coming with us.</p>
