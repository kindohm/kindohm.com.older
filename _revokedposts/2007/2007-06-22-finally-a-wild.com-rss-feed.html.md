title: "Finally, a Wild.com RSS Feed"
---

<p>The <a href="http://www.wild.com" target="_blank">Minnesota Wild's web site</a> finally created an <a href="http://wild.nhl.com/rss/index.htm" target="_blank">RSS feed for it's news items</a>.  This is long, long overdue and it's been the main reason I haven't really cared to visit wild.com.  The new feed was a part of the new wild.com launch - which has a much improved look &amp; feel.  </p>
<p>On a related note, the Wild traded up today and drafted <a href="http://wild.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=322918&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page" target="_blank">Colton Gillies</a> today.  Big and physical forward.  Nicely done.  It's the exact type of player the Wild need for the modern day NHL.</p>
