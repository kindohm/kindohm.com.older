<p>This post is just as much a recruiting statement as it is a description of <a href="http://www.inetium.com" target="_blank">Inetium's</a> beautiful new office.  Today is our first day in the new space and there's a lot to take in.  It's huge compared to our old space, and there are a lot of nice new features.  </p>

<p>One of the biggest changes for us in this office is how great it looks. There's color everywhere instead of gray, bland wallpaper. There's new furniture, new lights, new everything. The developers also work in an open area now where natural light is let in, which is a nice change too.</p>

<p>The break room is pretty unique - it's more like a little restaurant. It's an inviting space and encourages small, impromptu meetings. There's also a dedicated XBox 360 and DVD player along with a flat panel screen in one corner.</p>

<p>As our company grew, our room-to-employee ratio fell quickly. We didn't have enough rooms for working on projects when collaboration was necessary. Now we have rooms dedicated to projects - which have white board surfaces on all of the interior walls. We also have a "think tank" - a space for impromptu meetings and discussions, which includes a cylindrical white board surface.</p>

<p>We also have a number of new conference rooms which are geared toward more formal meetings. They vary in size, but each has it's own dedicated, networked, flat-panel monitor and a fancy clear-glass marker board.</p>

<p>We'll see how everything works out in the next few weeks. I'm glad to be in the new space and like how it turned out. Best of all, I'm not rubbing elbows with coworkers at a table anymore :)</p>
