<p>All 30 of the NHL teams are unveiling new uniforms this year with the introduction of the <a href="http://www.rbkedgeuniform.com/" target="_blank">RBK Edge Uniform System</a>.  The new jerseys and even some new team logos for the upcoming season can be viewed at <a href="http://rbkedgejersey.com/" target="_blank">rbkedgejersey.com</a>, among other various sites.  </p>
<p>I've seen very little positive reaction to the new look.  I can't say I've researched fan reaction to the new jerseys extensively, but in general the die-hard, traditional NHL fans dislike them.  They think the tighter, sleeker look makes the NHL look too much like the European leagues. </p>
<p>I've always maintained that the NHL and its die-hard fans are old-fashioned and stubborn.  Fans don't want the game to be changed, but yet they think the game is too "defensive" and teams play too conservatively.  League officials have talked, talked, talked, and talked for years about making rule changes but have implemented very few.  While the NFL's rules and officiating are borderline out of control (in my opinion), the NFL liberally makes changes to keep pace with the modern athlete and modern fan.  The NHL should follow suit. </p>
<p>The new jerseys are another <em>small</em> step in the right direction by the NHL, as they supposedly permit more movement, faster skating, and more comfort (e.g. ventilation) for players.  From an ideal perspective, the best NHL athletes will benefit from these changes and will gain an advantage on the ice - and possibly create more score and a more exciting game.  </p>
<p>I'm personally glad the Wild changed their home sweater to the old "third jersey" style.  It's unique and looks better than the old green ones.  It makes me wonder what the Wild will come up with for a new 3rd-jersey next season (NHL teams cannot use a 3rd-jersey in the inaugural season of the RBK Edge uniforms).  I also like the subtle changes that were made to the two new jerseys.  However, I dislike the fact that I'll need to open up my wallet to get an updated uniform :)</p>
