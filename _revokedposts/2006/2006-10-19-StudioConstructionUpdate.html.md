<p><img src="http://www.greengluecompany.com/images/index/greenGlueTubes2.png" align="right" width="150" style="margin: 6px;" />After much researching over the past couple of days I've made a decision about what to do with my <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2006/10/17/ResilientChannelNOTDone.aspx">resilient channel problem</a>.  Regardless of what I decided, I have to tear down all of the RC from the walls.  I've decided to <strong>not</strong> put it back up, but I'll still keep it on the ceiling.  </p>
  
<p>What I've learned is that there is an arguably <em>better</em> product to decrease sound transmission through walls called <a href="http://greengluecompany.com" target="_blank">Green Glue</a> (GG).  GG is an adhesive that you sandwich between two layers of drywall, and then you put the whole sandwich up on the wall frame.  GG has produced the same sound transmission loss levels as RC in labs.  GG can be used in combination with RC, but the gains are very, very small.  Given that RC is difficult to work with, it's not really worth putting back up if I'm going to use GG.</p>
  
<p>However, RC does have a benefit if your walls aren't isolated from the rest of the structure of your house.  That's a <em>little</em> true in my case.  My wall frames aren't 100% isolated from the rest of my house, but the contact with other house framing members has been minimized.  Thus I don't think the money and effort put into re-hanging the RC will give me much benefit.  GG by itself should do a good job.  </p>
  
<p>So this weekend I'll be tearing down the RC.  It should go pretty quick.  Tearing down is always easier :)</p>
  
<p>As a side note - I wish I would have come across my studio construction resources years ago.  I would have built my studio very differently.  In a way, I even have a bug for wanting to try and build another one!  But who am I kidding?  Maybe if and when Nikki, Eva, and I move into a new house I'll consider it :)</p>
