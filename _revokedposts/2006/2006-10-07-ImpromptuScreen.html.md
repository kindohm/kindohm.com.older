<p>We'll be using a video projector for the LAN party on 10/13/2006, but I don't own a screen or have a good, plain wall to shine it on.  This morning I made a screen out of nine pieces of poster board:</p>

<p>Pretty snazzy eh?  It's bigger in real life than it looks like in the picture.  It's kind of a PITA to hang up so I hope I put it in a good place! </p>
