<p>I ordered one of these from TigerDirect.com last night:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1456601&amp;CatId=0" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.tigerdirect.com/SkuImages/gallery/large/A03-7068-a.JPG" width="200" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After doing a bit of research this model seemed to be the best option for me. It's inexpensive and also has better features compared to similar products like the <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=882297&amp;CatId=1428" target="_blank">Plextor ConvertX PX-AV100U</a>. The ADS model allows you to capture video as raw AVI, whereas I couldn't find any documentation on the Plextor that said it could capture as AVI. It only captures compressed MPEG.</p>
<p>XBox video capture, here I come!</p>
