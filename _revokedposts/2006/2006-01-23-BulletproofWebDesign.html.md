<p><img align="right" height="150" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0321346939.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" border="0"/>I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321346939/qid=1138025538/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-3855899-6873402?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" target="_blank">Bulletproof Web Design</a> by Dan Cederholm this weekend.  The book covers ways to deal with multiple browser types and evolving web sites by using CSS and XHTML.  While skimming through it in the store I already learned a few new things, and was instantly hooked.  Web design, page layouts, and CSS have always been an area of interest to me.  I'm no graphic designer, but I've always enjoyed tackling an interesting web design regardless of the complexity or number of its images.  Personally I'm not as interested in designing for multiple browsers - I think that different browsers will display web content more consistently as per w3c specs over time.  I'm more interested to read about the book's approach to separating content from design with CSS.  </p>
