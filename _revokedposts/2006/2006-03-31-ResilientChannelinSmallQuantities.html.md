title: "Resilient Channel in Small Quantities"
---

<p>I've been looking for resilient channel in this quanity for about two years: <a href="http://www.wwbw.com/Auralex-RC8-Resilient-Channel-i35965.music" target="_blank">resilient channel from Woodwind and Brasswind</a>.  It's a material used to aid in soundproof room construction.  In the past I've gone to builders and retailers like Home Depot to buy/order this stuff, but they won't sell it in small quantities because it's a very specialized building material.  I only need it for a room that is less than 15' x 15', and Home Depot would only sell me a whole pallet.  </p>
  
<p>Nikki and I are trying to make a big push to get our basement finished.  We're close to being ready for drywall, but before we put up drywall I have to hang this stuff first in the music room.  I'm stoked.  </p>
