title: "Pumpkin Carving with a Dremel Rotary Tool"
---

<p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" src="http://woodbymail.com/dremel/400_pd.jpg" align="right" />Yesterday we carved a few pumpkins. Last year I used an electric drill, this year I tried a Dremel rotary tool. All I have to say is that it doesn't really work that well. Pictures to follow later.... It just wasn't very easy to cut through a pumpkin for some reason. Next year, I'm using a hammer.</p>
