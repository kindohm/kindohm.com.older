title: "Converted to Subtext"
---

<p>The site's conversion to Subtext is done, and it was <em><strong>completely</strong></em> hassle and bug free.  The folks at <a href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">SubText</a> did an excellent job with the .Text import utility and the Subtext installation screens.  What's even better is that all of the permalinks on the site still work.  </p>
  
<p>So...  I had to update my current skin to work with Subtext, and in the process of making small changes to get it to work, I took advantage of some of the new Subtext controls.  In this skin, you'll see a new Search feature and also a calendar to take you to a specific day in the archives.  I'm psyched about the Search feature - it's such a basic thing that kindohm.com has been lacking.  </p>
  
<p>Let me know if you find any problems.  Enjoy.</p>
