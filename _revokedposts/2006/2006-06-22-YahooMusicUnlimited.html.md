title: "Yahoo Music Unlimited"

<p><a href="http://www.justaddcode.com/blog" target="_blank">Neil</a> has been trying to pursuade me to try out and use <a href="http://music.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo Music</a> for a while now, and yesterday I finally caved and tried it out.  I don't know why I waited so long - it's a pretty cool thing.  For $5 a month you can subscribe to Yahoo Music Unlimited and have access to a ridiculous amount of music. </p>
  
<p>If there's a downside to it, it's that there's so much music that I can't focus on anything specific.  Their software allows you to search and link to related music as you're listening to something.  So while I was listening to Peeping Tom I thought, "oh yeah, there's a whole bunch of other Mike Patton stuff I wanted to listen to".  So I searched for Tomahawk and listened to Mit Gas for a while, then came across some Fantomas stuff.  The chain of artists kept going from there - Melvins, Slayer, Morbid Angel, Diecide, Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power, Anthrax's I'm the Man EP, Stereolab (ok, no logical connection there), Nirvana's In Utero (I sold it ages ago and have missed some of those tunes), and finally Alice In Chain's self-titled final CD.  </p>
  
<p>I'm finding that I'm not even listening to entire songs because it's too tempting to keep clicking around and listen to other stuff.</p>
  
<p>Other artists I'm looking forward to finding and listening to: Operation Ivy, The Wood Brothers, Ween, Endo....</p>
  
<p>....and it's all only $5 a month!  </p>
