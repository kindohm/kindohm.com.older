title: "Nuclear power is SO five minutes ago"

<p>Why, why, why?</p>

<p>Yes, I know that nuclear power is a "benchmark" that some nations use to indicate that they are self-sufficient and cool and hip.  But nuclear power is <em><strong>so</strong></em> 90's.  Hell, it's <em><strong>so</strong></em> Cold War.  I guess it just wouldn't be the same to see a headline like "UN demands Iran to back down from Solar-power technology; Isreal threatens with hydro-electric strike".</p>
