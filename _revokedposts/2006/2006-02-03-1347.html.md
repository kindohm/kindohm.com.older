<p>Seriously...  everyone is different so I don't think the article's point is true for all gamers, but it's true for me.  When I'm just having fun, and even goofing off in a game, I tend to play better (and I sometimes stop goofing off).  Plus in real life, I'm a pretty laid back person and not much bothers me, so that explains why I'm SO good at everything in real life *rolls eyes*</p>
  
<p>Here's another short article about taking your personality into the game: <a href="http://tiedtheleader.blogspot.com/2006/02/residual-self-image.html" target="_blank">http://tiedtheleader.blogspot.com/2006/02/residual-self-image.html</a>.  <em>"I can safely tell you that a drawer filled with Killtacular medals does not amount to ability to kill an orange frisbee as it tries to escape your scatter of shot"</em>.</p>
