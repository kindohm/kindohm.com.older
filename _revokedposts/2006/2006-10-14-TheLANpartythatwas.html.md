<p>...awesome!</p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kindohm/269280049/" target="_blank"><img height="180" alt="halo5_0001" src="http://static.flickr.com/108/269280049_553f11b4ef_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></a> The party was great - complete with shenanigans and tom-foolery.  Here are some brief tidbits:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Twelve people showed up - we had a lot of cancellations within 24 hours before we started, and a surprising number of people never showed up who said they would. Those bastards. Twelve is still a great number though and mass carnage ensued...  </li>
<li>Lots of great games - lots of great CTF games, lots of bad one-sided ones, team King on Terminal... too many others to mention.  </li>
<li>Captured a ton of raw gameplay footage with the USB video capture device  </li>
<li>Everyone, and I literally mean everyone, brought at least a six pack of beer or some other type of tasty alcoholic beverage. Most people brought more. Plus, I already had the fridge and a cooler stocked with about 24 beers. Do the math... the remainder is a stock of leftover, unopened alcohol in my house :)  </li>
<li>One person (to be named later...) was dared to chug four garlic-butter cups and top them off with a shot of Jim Beam for $10. It was all caught on video... </li></ul> 
<p>I'm editing a few videos from the camcorder and video-capture footage. We'll see how long it takes but they should be fun to watch. We didn't really take a lot of pictures this time around. Just too much time spent having fun on the controller :)</p>
