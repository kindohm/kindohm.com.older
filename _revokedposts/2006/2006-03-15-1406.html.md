title: "Converting to Subtext"
---

<p>Kindohm.com will undergo its first major architectural change in a long, long time in the next few days.  I've been running on the .Text blog engine for about a year and a half now.  <a href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a> is out now, and I'll be converting .Text over to Subtext.  As a result, I need to overwrite the existing application files and convert the old database.  Plus there are some existing folders on my site that conflict with the names of new folders that need to be created.  With luck, the conversion will go quickly and be bug-free.  But it's a guarantee that some old image links will break.  Nothing major - just some images from old posts here and there.  </p>
  
<p>But anyway, for the 2+ users out there who actually check in here from time to time, things might get a little shaky as any kinks are worked out.</p>
