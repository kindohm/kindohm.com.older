<p><img src="http://nikon.bungie.org/conceptart/art/nextgentrooper.thumb.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 5px;" alt="mc" /> Yes, there is. You can actually view the entire background history and timeline of the <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> story originating on Earth in the year 2160 to 2552 (post-First Strike and pre-Halo 2) at <a href="http://halosm.bungie.org/story/halostory.timeline.html" target="_blank">HBO's Halo Story Timeline</a>. Most people probably aren't interested in all those details in the timeline. I'll probably be told that I need to get a life for writing about this :) Oh well. It's fun sci-fi. </p>
<p>Halo 2, the graphic novel, and another Halo novel by Eric Nylund entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765315688/ref=ord_cart_shr/104-5840764-7523121?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" target="_blank">Ghosts of Coral</a></em> continue the story and timeline. <em>Ghosts of Coral</em> will be out on 10/31/2006, and I'll definitely be picking it up. Sadly, these books are about the only ones that I read. At all. I get crap from a lot of peers about not reading. What can I say... I'm scared of books. A book tried to eat me once. </p>
