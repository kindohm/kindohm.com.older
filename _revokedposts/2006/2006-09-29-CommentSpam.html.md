title: "Comment Spam"
---

<p>My site fell victim to some pretty serious comment spam last night. In my inbox this morning I had about 94 new messages - each reporting a new comment. They were all comments on pretty old posts, and sure enough they're all for pr0n and the like. I'll have to dig into SQL to get rid of them efficiently. </p>
<p>All this provides more support to upgrading to the lastest version of <a title="Subtext" href="http://www.subtextproject.com" target="_blank">Subtext</a>, which has better comment spam prevention. </p>
