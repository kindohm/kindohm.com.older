title: "Basement Drywall Bids"
---

<p>I just received a 2nd bid from a contractor to hang, tape, and mud drywall in my basement, and I'm surprised at how different the two bids are.  One first for about $2500, the 2nd is for about $5000 - literally a 100% difference.  Both contractors that came and performed the measurements were great - they showed up on time, communicated with me promptly, answered all of my questions, and acted professionally.  I had another drywall contractor come by almost a year ago, and he was a total slime ball.  I like these other two guys.</p>
  
<p>So it's no question who I'll choose.  The $2500 price tag is still painful though - however I've committed to contracting out the taping and mudding, and it's only about $500 more to get the entire job done (including hanging drywall for the total $2500 price).  </p>
  
<p>I've also decided to hang the drywall myself in the studio room.  I don't want a contractor to go near that room.  But in order for the contractor to get in I need to hang the drywall in that room first so they can tape it.  I'm hoping to find time in December but I'm not optimistic I will.  However I think the entire drywall phase will be complete by the end of January, and that's pretty exciting.</p>
