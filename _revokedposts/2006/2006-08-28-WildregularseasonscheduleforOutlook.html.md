title: "Wild regular season schedule for Outlook"

<p><img style="MARGIN: 5px" src="http://images.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/_photos/2003-05-11-inside-gaborik.jpg" align="right" />The days are just getting a little cooler, the sun is setting a little earlier, and NFL training camps are beginning to wrap up. All this can only mean one thing: the 2006-2007 NHL season is only about a month away!</p>
<p>That's right. For those of you who follow the Minnesota Wild, make sure you get the <a href="http://www.wild.com/schedule/DownloadableSchedule.asp" target="_blank">downloadable Outlook schedule</a> that you can import into Outlook. It'is one of the very few nice features that wild.com provides. Otherwise for the most part wild.com is lame. They put a lot of effort into that site but it just looks kind of tacky to me, and there aren't ANY RSS feeds anywhere to be found. Kind of hard to use and navigate through too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leejsackett.com" target="_blank">Lee</a> and I will be meeting to divide up our season tickets sometime soon. It's always a really fun thing we do each year. I'm usually surprised at his "top games" that he goes for, but that's ok because then I get the ones I want :) This year we'll probably be selling off more of our tickets than we have in the past. If any of you out there would be interested in buying a bunch of games, let me know and I'll put you on my list. I'll probably just send out a massive email to everyone who is interested once I get my games and decide which ones I don't want, and then it's first-come-first-serve after that.</p>
<p>It should be a pretty exciting season for the Wild with all the new talent they picked up. The club has closed their first chapter and is beginning a new one this year. </p>
