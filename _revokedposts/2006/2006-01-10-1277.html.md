title: "More Demo Goodies"
---

<p>I dug up a few old demos again from the <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/Basic.aspx">Basic</a> album:</p> 
<ul>  
<li><a href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Basic/Demos,%20B-Sides/Kindohm.Basic.Demos.Complicated%20Maze%20Demo.mp3">Complicated Maze Demo</a> (<a href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Basic/Kindohm-Basic-04-ComplicatedMaze.mp3">listen to the real version</a>) - I actually recorded this tune about five times before the final version.  The main reason for that is because it was the first tune I really worked on after I got my Yamaha digital workstation.  There are a few other demo versions of this song floating around my house on CDs somewhere, but here's the first one I've ever posted.  This is one of my poorer vocal performances.  I sound bored.  I'm not singing in tune very well, but that's no suprise :)</li>  
<li><a href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Basic/Demos,%20B-Sides/Kindohm.Basic.Demos.Making%20Future%20Go%20Demo.mp3">Making Future Go Demo</a> (<a href="http://wss.kindohm.com/Basic/Kindohm-Basic-01-MakingFutureGo.mp3">listen to the real version</a>) - Again, I was learning how to use my new Yamaha recorder with this one.  This sounds way different than the final version on the CD.  It sounds thin and not very powerful, and obviously doesn't have any vocals yet.  The snare has a nice crack to it though.</li> </ul>
