title: "Interactive Robot Drummer"
---

<p>This is pretty cool.  Back in the days of academia I built and programmed robots and I've had an interest in trying to get back into it on a smaller scale and trying to use .Net code to control them.  This guy definately put in quite a bit of work to build that entire thing, let alone program the drum part.  </p>
  
<p>Not sure why the guy is sitting on such a tall chair though :)</p>
