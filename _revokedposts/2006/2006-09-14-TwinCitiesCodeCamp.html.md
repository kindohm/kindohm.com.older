title: "Twin Cities Code Camp"
---

<p>The <a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/" target="_blank">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> is happening on November 11th at Microsoft's Bloomington office. It's an event for area developers to come and immerse themselves in code, code, and more code! </p>
<p>It's held at Microsoft but is not limited to Microsoft technologies. <a href="http://www.thoughtstoblog.com/" target="_blank"><a title="Jake" href="http://www.thoughtstoblog.com" target="_blank">Jake</a></a> will be presenting on Ruby on Rails. They're looking for more presenters (last I heard, 6 of 28 slots were filled), and topics can span the entire spectrum of <em><strong>code</strong></em>. Go ahead and sign up to speak on VB6 if you want! Well - as long as you have a <em>good</em> topic. There is information on the main page on how to sign up.  I'm very eager to see the list of topics as it grows.</p>
