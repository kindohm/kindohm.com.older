title: "A couple new Sidetracked videos"
---

<p>Last week <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net" target="_blank">Jason</a> and I held a recording session at my house for some acoustic guitar work.  Here are some videos that document the very important event:</p>
  
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/videos/SidetrackedRecordingSession-2006-09-28-HiRes.wmv">Session video</a> (15 MB)  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.kindohm.com/videos/SidetrackedRecordingSession-2006-09-28-HappyVersion-HiRes.wmv">Session video (happy version)</a> (7 MB) </li></ul>  
<p>Keep in mind that both videos are to be taken very, very seriously.  The "happy" version is of the same ilk as a previous video we did last year that <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/videos/Sidetracked%20Practice%207-14-2005b.wmv">you can view here</a>.</p>
  
<p>I'd prefer to upload these to YouTube rather than hosting them on my domain except that as far as I know YouTube doesn't support the wide screen ratio (grrrrr).  I mean, who makes videos in the old ratio?  Oh, I guess a lot of people do.  </p>
  
<p>Also, I don't think I'll ever use Windows Movie Maker again.  I have another program (Pinnacle Studio 9) which I hated back when I got my camcorder, but now I realize it's much better.  The performance can be a bit slow, but that's because of my computer.  WMM really isn't much better anyway.  But when it comes to the video processing, Pinnacle is much faster and smoother.  It also works with the video in raw AVI format.  WMM uses the WMV format right from the start and quality is sacrificed in the compression.  </p>
