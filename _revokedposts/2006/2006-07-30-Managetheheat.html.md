title: "Manage the heat"

<p>All I have to say is that perspiration, sunburn, and margaritas don't mix together very well.  Or, you could also say that they mix together to create a hell of a headache.  All three of those things suck water out of your body, and a headache is one of the early signs of dehydration.  Make sure you drink yer water during this Twin Cities heat wave that is spanning across a few weeks now.  "Ok thanks dad".  I'm going to be one of those nagging fathers I can just tell now....</p>
<p>On Friday I got a nasty sunburn while at a beach with Nikki and Eva, and at night we topped off the hot day with some fantastic Mexican (enchiladas, beans and rice.  mmmm) and margaritas.  A perfect finish to a great summer day.  But by the time I went to bed I had bright red shoulders and a raging headache.  I didn't really keep up with water during the day.  Oh well, headache or not, the sunburn and margaritas were worth it :)</p>
