title: "Cartographic data import progress"
---

<p>My cartographic file parser is working the way I want it to now.  There are four total files that describe states and counties for all 50 states, and two files for each state that describe cities and two files for each state that describe zip codes.  I've parsed all of the state and county data, and have parsed 13 states worth of cities and zip codes.  Those 14 states include Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, and Nebraska.</p>
  
<p>Some interesting stats so far:</p>
  
<ul>   
<li>21,018 unique boundaries have been imported (a state, city, county, or zip code)</li>   
<li>2,737,277 individual latitude and longitude points have been imported</li>   
<li>Alaska has the greatest number of total points (13,756)</li>   
<li>Washington County in Oregon has the second greatest number of total points (10,436)</li>   
<li>The city with the geratest number of points is Columbus, OH (2,393)</li> </ul>  
<p>Greatest number of points by state:</p>
<ol>   
<li>Alaska (13,756)</li>   
<li>Texas (6913)</li>   
<li>Michigan (5254)</li>   
<li>Minnesota (5192)</li>   
<li>West Virginia (4929)</li> 
</ol>  
<p>Fewest number of points by state:</p>
<ol>   
<li>Wyoming (522)</li>   
<li>Utah (570)</li>   
<li>Delaware (589)</li>   
<li>Colorado (601)</li>   
<li>Rhode Island (688)</li> 
</ol>  
<p>Greatest number of points by city:</p>
<ol>   
<li>Columbus, OH(2393)</li>   
<li>Joliet, IL (1326)</li>   
<li>Springfield, IL (1261)</li>   
<li>Dayton, OH (1168)</li>   
<li>Decatur, IL (1052)</li> 
</ol>  
<p>I guess either the data collector who did Illinois and Ohio was very detail oriented, or cities in those states just have complex boundaries :)</p>
  
<p>Fewest number of points by city:</p>
<ol>   
<li>Lithium, MO (5)</li>   
<li>McGrath, MN (6)</li>   
<li>Urbank, MN (6)</li>   
<li>Cordova, NE (6)</li>   
<li>19 others tied at 6</li> 
</ol>  
<p>Other notables:</p>
  
<ul>   
<li>Madison, WI (986)</li>   
<li>Rochester, MN (554)</li>   
<li>Minneapolis, MN (235)</li>   
<li>Duluth, MN (264)</li>   
<li>Hennepin County (473)</li> </ul>
