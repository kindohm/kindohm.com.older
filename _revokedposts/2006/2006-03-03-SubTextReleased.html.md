<p>Maybe, just maybe, gone are the days of using .Text for kindohm.com.  .Text is old, quirky, and unsupported (even though I love the skinning abilities).  It'd be nice to use a similar engine but with a few improvements.  I've yet to install it somewhere and dig in, but I'm eager to see what it has.</p>
