Woohoo happy birthday Eva! On Saturday we had a party for her in our backyard and it was pretty fun. We took about 160 pictures, but unfortunately they're all on our home computer which I rarely use these days. I'll have to make some time for getting the good ones up on Flickr. </p>
<p>Eva also had her 12-month checkup today and got four different vaccinations. She also had her finger poked for a hemoglobin test. She was actually pretty curious about getting her finger poked - she just watched the technician and her finger and smiled the whole time. I was expecting screams and tears but instead she actually enjoyed it. Weird kid :) </p>
