title: "Featured Music Library Tune - Queen"
---

<p>In an effort to kill time during lunch and let people know how terrible of a musician I am, I'm featuring a tune from my music library: <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/musiclibrary/Pages/SongDetail.aspx?SongID=284f3678-7067-4107-81b1-655e3b80cdc9">Queen (click to view)</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly how this tune came into existence. It's just a random metal punk thing, and about 4/5 of the way through I accidentally dropped my drumsticks and just stopped playing. I recorded the guitars over the drums and just ended it there where I dropped my sticks. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most unique aspect of the song are the lyrics, which are 100% improvised on the spot. I was basically singing about my surroundings and the objects in front of me: a shelf full of snare drums, orange carpet used for acoustic dampening, some tape, etc. It's tough to hear what each word is but if you listen carefully it's a little amusing.</p>
