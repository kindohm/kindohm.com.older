title: "Electrical Inspection #1"
---

<p>In the words of the electrical inspector: "It was all looking great until we got <em><strong>here</strong></em> (the bathroom)".</p>
<p>Basically, the entire basement looked good to him except the bathroom needs to be on its own circuit.  It shouldn't be too bad to do because I don't have to really disconnect much - I just need to run a new cable from the service box and hook it up to the existing entry box in the bathroom.  The main downside is it'll take a little more time and I need to call him back to have him inspect the work again.  It could have been a lot worse though :)  I'm just happy that this milestone has been reached and that I know where I stand for the electrical work.</p>
<p>So, this weekend I hope to get those changes made and have him come back on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
