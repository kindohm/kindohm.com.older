<p>Nikki and I launched <a href="http://www.enduringblooms.com" target="_blank">EnduringBlooms.com</a> last night.  It's a site for Nikki's mom, who is a watercolor artist.  Right now it's a simple site to showcase some work and provide information about how to buy paintings.  She ultimately would like to allow people to buy prints directly from the site, but she wanted to keep it simple to start with.</p>
  
<p>Her work is amazing, and the website doesn't do it justice.  In person her paintings are very vivid, and much much larger.  We have a few in our house and they are beautiful.</p>

<p>The site itself was pretty straightforward from a technical standpoint.  With the time and resources we had, we pretty much had to.  No fancy user experience - just organized content.  Nikki and I ended up really enjoying working together on this (she did the graphic design, I did the development, and we both worked on the UI).</p>
  
<p>Definitely check the site out if you're looking for some beautiful art.</p>
