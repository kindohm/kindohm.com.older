<p><img align="right" style="MARGIN: 5px" alt="Johnson battles the flood" src="http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/03/Nihei_HGN.jpg" width="200" />My copy of the <a title="Halo" href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Halo</a> Graphic Novel came in yesterday. It's kinda neat. There are four stories in it, and in a way I'm a little disappointed because it's such a short "book". Oh well. The content that <strong><em>is</em></strong> there is fun to read, and adds more questions and answers to the Halo story. e.g. one of the stories practically confirms that the "Ark" is on Earth. Another is about a retired Spartan (Maria) and she mentions that she started a family. Ummm, ok. </p>
<p>The other two stories are about one encounter that the Covenant have with the Flood and also about Sgt. Johnson and how he escaped from the Flood in Halo: CE. The last section of the book is all art and drawings of characters. </p>
<p>Overall I was expecting more, but the price was right at $16.49 on Amazon.</p>
