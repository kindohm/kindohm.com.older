title: "Free Music Recording Magazine - TapeOp"
---

<p>I just got my first issue of a free magazine called <a href="http://www.tapeop.com" target="_blank">TapeOp</a>. TapeOp is a free music recording magazine that makes its money through gear advertisements. So far I'm loving it - they interview producers, engineers and musicians about studios and gear. The interviews range from experienced pros who have rare, expensive gear to unknown guys who buy used stuff and accept any offer to record someone's music. </p>
<p>Even if you're only mildly into recording then you have nothing to lose by signing up for a subscription. I've read about three of the articles so far and I've already learned a thing or two. All you need to provide to TapeOp is a valid email address. And these days it's easy to provide an alternate address that you don't care about getting spammed (if you're concerned about providing your email address for a magazine subscription). Just go to <a href="http://www.tapeop.com" target="_blank">TapeOp.com</a> and sign up.</p>
