title: "New Yamaha digital hard disk recorder"

<p><img src="http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/Images/ProAudio/Product/Main/AW1600_front_main.jpg" align="right" />Yahama has now replaced their AW16G hard disk recording workstation with the <a href="http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail/0,,CNTID%253D48575%2526CTID%253D228500,00.html" target="_blank">new AW1600</a>.  The new model has a number of new features, but the key ones are eight combo inputs (versus two) and a USB interface for transfering data with a computer.  Man I would have loved to have had those features for the past few years.  </p>
  
<p>Looks like the old AW16G's have a "buy it now" price on eBay for about $500.  Ouch.  I was hoping for a higher trade-in value.  I really would like to trade in my old model but it looks like I'll need to save up more than I thought I would.</p>
