<p>I stumbled across this track recently and decided to upload it:</p>

<p><em>"This tune was written and recording quite a while ago... probably about three years ago sometime in 2004. I only stumbled across it recently. It didn't make it on a CD or anything. Here it is in all its glory, or lack thereof."</em></p>
<p><em>"The captured tracks are really weird... the guitars sound big, but they sound like they're in a box or something. The drums are tuned way way down... the snare is just tuned so low that only the high-end attack and "splat" of the snares really gets through... no tone or anything." </em></p>
<p><em>"The entire mix has the crap compressed out of it and it's pretty loud."</em></p>
