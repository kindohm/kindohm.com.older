<p>I was just thinking the other day that Bungie really should have re-made the Chill Out map (from Halo: CE) for Halo 3.  I remember many an epic multiplayer battle on that map - back in the day when the game was limited by 4 consoles and the pistol fired automatic rounds with a scope!</p>
  
<p>The map, renamed "Cold Storage", has some preview images available at the link above.  </p>
  
<p>Bungie has never done remakes of my three favorite Halo: CE maps: Prisoner, Damnation, and Rat Race. And who can forget <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Chiron_TL-34" target="_blank">Chiron TL 34</a>?  </p>
