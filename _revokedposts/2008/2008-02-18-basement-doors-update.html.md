title: "Basement Doors Update"
---

<p>Last week, I went around and around with Home Depot trying to get information about the four doors that I ordered.  Nobody wanted to give me information.  I kept getting excuses like "I'll have the guy that you worked with on the order call you back" or "I'm just filling in today...can I get your number and someone will call you back?".  </p>
<p>I finally found out that the doors were never ordered.  Apparently, the person who originally helped me with the order has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis" target="_blank">MS</a> and is getting let go because he can't perform his job very well.  I was told that he frequently forgets to writing things down or forgets to follow up on things.  No kidding.  </p>
<p>This is pretty frustrating.  The doors were supposed to have been ordered three weeks ago, and now they won't get in for another three weeks.  I'm planning on making a case to Home Depot to give me a discount on the doors <strong><em>and</em></strong> to expedite the order.  Who knows if the Joe and Jane Doe clerks will listen to me though.</p>
