title: "Introducing the Error Alpaca"
---


<p>Before I get to the Error Alpaca, I have to explain that I&#8217;m reviving my good old <a href="http://kindohm.com" target="_blank">kindohm.com</a> web site to be my personal internet end point for information about me. <a href="http://hodnick.com" target="_blank">Hodnick.com</a> will continue to live on for blog/article posts. Rss feed URLs haven&#8217;t changed. It&#8217;s a personal internet identity crisis that has now been put to rest.</p>
























  
<p>The new kindohm.com is a new informational source for me: bio, music, code, etc. It&#8217;s a new, simple design and I encourage you to check it out and let me know what you think.</p>
























  
<p>With this new design and domain switch, I decided to implement new standard error pages for kindohm.com that handle basic 400, 404, and 500 error codes.</p>
























  
<p>This is where the Error Alpaca comes in. The Error Alpaca politely lets you know that some type of problem occurred on the site:</p>

<p>You can reproduce this error by following this link: <a href="http://kindohm.com/bad.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://kindohm.com/bad.htm" target="_blank">http://kindohm.com/bad.htm</a></a></p>
























  
<p>I can&#8217;t easily reproduce the other error types, but the Error Alpaca can specifically handle the 401, 404, and 500 error codes. If another type of error occurs, it can handle that one generically:</p>

<p><img src="/hodsmedia/1053489668_4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
























  
<p><img src="/hodsmedia/1053489668_5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
























  
<p>I must say that I&#8217;ve never enjoyed handling error conditions more.</p>
