title: "NHL 2009 Playoff Predictions"
---

<p>Another post-season NHL writing where I flail around and predict the unpredictable.  Here are my 2009 picks for the NHL postseason.  But, before I get started - I'm going to change things up a bit this year and write a new prediction before each round of the Stanley Cup playoffs start.  The main reason is because the matchups change each round - it's not a precise bracket.  </p>
  
<p><strong>Western Conference</strong></p>
  
<p>First we have San Jose and Anaheim. A lot of folks are talking "upset" with this series but I say no.  San Jose proved themselves to be too strong in the regular season, even if Anaheim is ending their season strong.  Both teams have a lot of recent playoff experience.  Both have veterans, strong talent, and great goaltending.  San Jose will win in seven games.</p>
  
<p>Detroit - Columbus.  This is Columbus's first ever playoff appearance.  Detroit in four games.</p>
  
<p>Vancouver - St. Louis.  Nice to see St. Louis in the mix again, but their talent is young.  Vancouver has much more experienced players and I think will be playing harder for the Stanley Cup.  Vancouver in five games.</p>
  
<p>Chicago - Calgary.  I think this is going to be a real tough, grinding series.  I want to say that Calgary will be an easy pick for the series win but they haven't looked so good down the stretch.  Outstanding goaltending on both teams.  I'll give the edge to Calgary though because they are grittier and tougher.  Calgary in seven games.</p>
  
<p><strong>Eastern Conference</strong></p>
  
<p>Boston - Montreal.  There is no comparison between these two teams.  Boston ran away with the East this year.  Boston in four games.</p>
  
<p>Washington - NY Rangers.  Washington has Ovechkin and Semin.  NY doesn't, but I think they will give Washington a hard time.  Washington in seven games.  </p>
  
<p>New Jersey - Carolina.  New Jersey has Brodeur, Carolina does not.  Brodeur tips the balance.  New Jersey in seven.</p>
  
<p>Pittsburgh - Philadelphia.  Pittsburgh wasn't as tight defensively this year, and that's why they didn't catch Boston in the East.  Crosby and Malkin are virtually unstoppable though.  I think the Penguins lesser defense breaks down in a high-scoring, seven-game series.  Philadelphia in seven games.</p>
  
<p><strong>Stanley Cup Champion</strong></p>
  
<p>Who will win it all?  I'm going with Detroit.  They have unmatched talent <strong><em>and</em></strong> experience.  If Zetterberg, Datsyuk and Hossa all get injured, then we'll talk.  Who will they face in the East?  Probably Boston.  Boston has the best Goals For / Goals Against ratio in the league.  But so what?  They don't have Detroit's roster.  </p>
