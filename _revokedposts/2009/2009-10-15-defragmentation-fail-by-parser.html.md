title: "Defragmentation - FAIL (by Parser)"
---

<p>With my <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2009/10/03/new-online-music-library-hodsaudio.net.aspx" target="_blank">release of HodsAudio.net</a> a while back, I completely overlooked the fact that I released a new track with the <a href="http://hodsaudio.net/Album/Details/12" target="_blank"><em>Robots Stole My Computer</em></a> compilation.   </p>
  
<p>I present to you: <a href="http://hodsaudio.net/Song/Details/162" target="_blank"><em>Defragmentation: FAIL</em></a>, by Parser.   </p>
  
<p>As usual, I don't know how to classify this tune.  Geekcore?</p>
  
<p>The tune is a canvas of excessively hyper glitches and blips, underscored by some solid beats and soft textures.  Of everything I've ever worked on, I put more time into this track than anything else.  There's just a lot of content.  </p>
  
<p>Enjoy.</p>
