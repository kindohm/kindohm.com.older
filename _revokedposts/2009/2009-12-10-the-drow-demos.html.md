title: "The Drow Demos"

<p>I&#8217;ve released the demo audio from the time when I was writing the music for &#8220;<a href="http://hodsaudio.net/Album/Details/11" target="_blank">The Drow</a>&#8221;.  You can get the demo tracks here:</p>

<p>If you like The Drow, then I think you&#8217;ll like these demo tracks as they reveal all kinds of mistakes and incomplete aspects of the songs.  One song in particular is a completely different version than the final one: <a href="http://hodsaudio.net/Song/Details/285" target="_blank">Medium || Way</a>.</p>








  
<p>Hope you enjoy.</p>
