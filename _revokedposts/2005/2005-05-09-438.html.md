I think I need to replace the blades on my electric razor.&nbsp; I shaved my head this morning, and after I got to work I could feel little hairs all over that just didn't get picked up.&nbsp; Good thing I'm in an isolated room just with <a target="_blank" href="http://iwkid.blogspot.com">IWKid</a> today...&nbsp; I have a feeling it's a pretty funny sight from behind.&nbsp;
