title: "It feels good to be a coder"
---

<p>I've been putting some serious coding time into a personal project that I'm working on (<a href="http://www.virtualpuck.com/">www.virtualpuck.com</a>).&nbsp; I estimate that I've put about 20 hours into the design and development so far.&nbsp; It feels good to be going to bed after midnight on a regular basis again....</p>
<p>virtualpuck.com will be the heart of a fictitous, simulated hockey league.&nbsp; This isn't the first time I've attempted to create such a league, but this time around it will succeed because the design will work.&nbsp; Specifically, the simulation engine is planned and tested, and my experience with ASP.Net web development has&nbsp;become substantial enough&nbsp;(over 3 years) such that I can develop the site more quickly&nbsp;with higher quality (e.g. performance, bugs, appearance, etc).</p>
<p>In the past, the idea has resulted in a static site for people to just look at.&nbsp; This next design will allow site members (besides myself) to contribute content to help keep the site fresh and interesting.&nbsp; In the last version, I got really tired of updating static HTML content and eventually the site just became stagnant&nbsp;(except for the low-level game and player stats).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The other really cool thing about this project is that I'm incorporating serious unit testing with development.&nbsp; I'm not quite doing true <em>test-driven development</em>, but it's a huge improvement over how I've approached my personal projects in the past.&nbsp; I'm at least able to run unit tests with NUnit as I make and break stuff.&nbsp; It's a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So enough rambling.&nbsp; Just wanted to give an update since it's been a while.&nbsp; Ya.</p>
