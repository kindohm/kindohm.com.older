<p>Nikki and I finished cleaning out the new baby room and prepped it for painting yesterday.&nbsp; Thus, I moved all of my music gear out of the room down into our storage room in the basement.&nbsp; I didn't realize how much crap I actually owned until I had to move it all.&nbsp; Guitars, amps, comptuers, mixers, etc, etc, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Last night I really wanted to get some music-related work done, so I set up shop right in the storage room among shelves of camping gear, christmas decorations, the furance, the water heater, etc:</p>
