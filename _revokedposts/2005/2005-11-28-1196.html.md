title: "Never too late for the original XBox"
---

<p>My dad just picked up his first XBox this weekend while we were up visiting my parents.&nbsp; He's been thinking of getting one for a long time and finally made the purchase.&nbsp; I think it's pretty cool because he's 60 years old and plays video games.&nbsp; A lot of guys his age (e.g. Nikki's dad and step-dad) either don't have any interest in video games or are clueless when you put a controller in their hands.&nbsp; I remember back when I had an NES he got hooked on the original Legend of Zelda and completed it on his own.&nbsp; He pretty much sticks to the sports genre, and this weekend we played a lot of Forza and NHL 06 together.&nbsp; I can't imagine that he'd have much luck with Halo 2, as FPS games require a bit of independence among your hands and fingers - which is something he has a little trouble with.&nbsp; I think he could get the hang of it if he had time to play though.&nbsp; </p>
