<p>Your wildest dream has come true.&nbsp; Please welcome Kindohm Radio to the site.&nbsp; Actually, it's just an m3u playlist, but whatever.&nbsp; Click the Kindohm Radio link above in the main nav bar, or you can link to it <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/files/KindohmPlayList.m3u">here</a>.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything is in the playlist except tunes from <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/IInventedPlastic.aspx">Plastic</a>.&nbsp; I'm just not very proud of that one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyway...&nbsp; play it, shuffle it, and repeat.</p>
