title: "Unit Testing SharePoint Code - an update"
---

<p>My team is still working on the challenges of <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/02/428.aspx">unit testing SharePoint code</a>, and we're making good progress.&nbsp; The direction we've decided to go in is to perform all unit tests on the SharePoint server, wherever that may be.&nbsp; Testing with mock objects or through remote calls resulted in a lot of pain and difficulty.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, we've noted a few things that we'd like to accomplish to make&nbsp;the deployment and execution of app/test code&nbsp;on a remote SharePoint server as simple as possible.&nbsp; Our ultimate goal is to create a (web) service that resides on the server that will allow you to upload any required files for performing a test (your test and app dll's, configs, etc), execute NUnit against the specified test assembly, and return NUnit's Xml results.&nbsp; For cases when you need to debug your test code, the developer will need to deploy their code by hand (e.g. using a batch file), log on to the server, and use the .Net SDK GUI-Debug to debug their code.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Last night I took a shot at implementing the web service, and it ended up working out very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The service accepts the files as strings converted from byte arrays,&nbsp;saves the files locally in a temp directory on the server,&nbsp;executes NUnit against them, then returns the result from the console output of NUnit.&nbsp; You can include an XSLT stylesheet to format&nbsp;how you want your&nbsp;results to look too.&nbsp; Very, very simple, although I'm not posting any code yet because I'm not 100% happy with it yet :)</p>
<p>Ideally we'd like to write a VS.Net add-in so that you can do this all within the development environment instead of using some other client app for the service.&nbsp; Personally I'd like to see the add-in use a browser control so that you can view the test results as HTML.</p>
<p>In addition, we're also working on some abstract classes to take care of&nbsp;the typical set up and tear down operations - such as getting SPWeb and SPSite contexts etc.&nbsp; Since we don't have any REAL unit tests right now and this is all a hypothetical exercise, we'll likely just build out the abstract classes as we come up with more tests in the future.</p>
<p>Next time, more code, less talk!&nbsp;</p>
