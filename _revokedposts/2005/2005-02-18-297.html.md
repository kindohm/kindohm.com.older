title: "I Shaved My Head"
---

<p>That's right.&nbsp; I shaved my head this morning.&nbsp; Thanks to <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/" target="_blank">Jason</a> for some advice on how to go about doing it.&nbsp; The weirdest part about it isn't the look, but how it feels.&nbsp; It's like my head has been numb because it's had hair to buffer it from any sense of touch or something.&nbsp; I couldn't feel the water on my head in the shower.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But anyway...&nbsp; here's some proof:</p>

<p>But why stop there? Since I was on a roll with a cosmetic transformation, I thought I'd keep going:</p>

<p>Whoa! A little too much. So I backed it off a bit:</p>

<p>So if I look a little funny the next time you see me, this should explain it.</p>
