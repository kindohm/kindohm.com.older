title: "New tune - Rotator"
---

<p>It's been a while since I've produced anything, but here's something new:</p>
<p><a href="http://kindohm.developstuff.com/music/Electronica/Kindohm.Rotator.mp3">Download Kindohm.Rotator.mp3</a></p>
<p>Kinda my first legit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_n_bass">DnB</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music">IDM</a> mix.  I've done some of it in the past but I was using lousy tools and it just sounded corny.  Hopefully the first of many installments.  Enjoy.</p>
