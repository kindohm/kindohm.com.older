title: "AK!  (a chair)"
---

<p>I received a very unique and unexpected gift from Nikki for christmas this year.&nbsp; It's something that I've been wanting for a while, but I never dreamed of this particular design.&nbsp; I've always wanted a small on-the-floor chair that I could use to sit near the TV to play video games.&nbsp; Target sells them, but they look kinda cheap and lame.&nbsp; So, I was suprised to open a big package a few days ago with one of these in it:</p>

<p>It's basically a super-cool version of what I wanted, made by a company named <a href="http://www.ak.com/" target="_blank">AK Designs</a>. It looks way better than the cheap Target ones, and it's super comfortable. Plus, it lets you roll/recline back a full 90&#176;. So now I can play Halo 2 to the wee hours of the morning in comfort. Ok, so maybe not the wee hours part, but it's a lot of fun to use.
