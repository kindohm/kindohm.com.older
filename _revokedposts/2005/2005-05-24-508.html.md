<p>Why can't content and article authors on major websites write coherently with correct spelling and grammar?&nbsp; I was browsing through some Halo-related articles during lunch and came across these three:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mlgpro.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=617&amp;topic=21" target="_blank">http://www.mlgpro.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=617&amp;topic=21</a><br/><a href="http://www.mlgpro.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=620&amp;topic=21" target="_blank">http://www.mlgpro.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=620&amp;topic=21</a><br/><a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/Story.aspx?link=8F5BA4AF-04BF-4253-A565-3AF9FCD58FCC" target="_blank">http://www.bungie.net/News/Story.aspx?link=8F5BA4AF-04BF-4253-A565-3AF9FCD58FCC</a></p>
<p>The spelling and grammar are embarassing - especially in the MLGPro articles.&nbsp; How does this content get approved?&nbsp; Do the editors and authors even know that they could do better?&nbsp; Maybe the audience of these sites doesn't know any better either and there just isn't any demand for better writing.&nbsp; It just makes the authors look less credible and the organizations they work for less professional.&nbsp; </p>
