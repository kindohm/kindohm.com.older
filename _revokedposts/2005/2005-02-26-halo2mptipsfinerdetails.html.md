<div>I started typing and 
			just couldn't stop... <br /><br />First off, Spartans are much better 
			than elites. I don't care whether they get an extra inch off the 
			ground or shoot a bit faster with a plasma rifle, they have BIG 
			heads. It's so much easier to snipe an elite than to snipe a Spartan. 
			Elites look cool, yes, but are not tactically smart. Snipers are so 
			plentiful in the halo 2 world that this is a grand disadvantage and 
			can, many times, make the difference. <br /><br />Secondly, grenades 
			are THE most important strategic device in your arsenal. Frag grenades 
			specifically. Plasmas are one hit kill, IF you stick them. Which, 
			we all know, is much harder in 2. Plus, when playing more skilled 
			opponents, a sticky grenade is all to easy to dodge and even in the 
			player isn't dodging, they will likely walk in random patterns as to 
			make it much harder to stick. If you're a skilled player, use sticky 
			grenades as a last resort weapon or to sneak somebody who is camping 
			from a far distance. Back to frag grenades, though... Very effective! 
			A direct frag and a battle rifle shot directly after is deadly. Also, 
			2 frag grenades end in death. If you hit with the first grenade, they 
			will likely retreat, use this to throw one into their path. Throwing 
			grenades into an enemies likely path is a great thing to get used to. 
			Many times have I killed a sword, rocket or shotgun holder at medium 
			range as he charges at me with my good ol frags and an SMG. <br /><br />
			Next, vehicles. <br />Warthog: With a machine gun, average. With a 
			gauss cannon, great for skilled players. I myself have never gotten 
			used to the gauss cannon. Use this as a Skirmish vehicle (CTF, Aussult) 
			as transport for the holder. Make sure, however, that your team owns 
			the rocket launcer... That can be a very big triple kill. Unless the 
			enemy is backed towards a wall or a very new player or you think you 
			can sneak up on them (in a warthog!) don't try to ram them... With a 
			hog, not a very good tactic. When faced with the decision between 
			ramming or trying on foot, try on foot. Or, if you're in medium long 
			distance, jump out and into the turret. Sometimes sliding into them 
			kills them, but sometimes not. If you have a gunner in your hog, go 
			for him and it will at least damage their shields. Also, when in 
			gunner, watch sniper fire. Even though you're moving fast, a skilled 
			sniper in the right position can pick you off of the high perched 
			cannon. <br /><br />Ghosts: <br />Very wonderful... Extremely high 
			rate of attack and notorious when ramming. Sometimes very tough to 
			aim with though. Medium to short distances are good targets or at 
			non-moving opponents at any distance. A skilled player can dodge ghost 
			fire long enough to take you out via a well placed grenade or simple 
			BR fire so keep moving closer. Not too close, of course, because of 
			Bungies awesomeness! Unless you're boosting, a ghost is easy to board. 
			<br />Here's a nice little tactic I've picked up. When using the ghost 
			(or banshee) against a skilled player in close range, damage them a 
			bit and then get close enough for them to board you... You'll very 
			likely kill them before they board and definitely do a lot of damage. 
			Press X to get out before they board you and you'll have time to 
			shoot at their non-moving vehicle as they board. You'll kill them 
			and likely not damage your ghost at all! <br /><br />Banshee: 
			<br />Great for not only fighting, but quick transportation. On 
			most levels with the banshee you can easily jump RIGHT into the 
			enemy base onto the flag. This vehicle is very accurate. While 
			the flips may be a tempting little stunt, try not to use them too 
			much. You can't fire and your path is very predictable. When 
			dodging a rocket, use the left and right spin while facing them... 
			Otherwise, you're pretty much screwed. Also, ramming is quite fun 
			in this. Get above your target and a bit back... Then boost straight 
			down at them... This will either crush your enemy or send them FLYING. 
			A quick warning, ramming a flag carrier is sometimes dangerous. You 
			may send them flying TOWARDS their base, so if you attempt a smash 
			in the Banshee, face the other way. Also, the banshee is not capable 
			of flying more then straight down (if that) so make sure the enemy 
			is at least a bit in front of you so they don't slip from under you. 
			Make the last adjustment for aim nearer to the ground. A fun thing 
			to do which sometimes gives a bit of a tactical advantage is flipping 
			and VERY QUICKLY pressing X to jump out. You'll fly in the direction 
			you pressed. You can boost yourself across the map with some tricky 
			bunny hopping or launch yourself high and avoid fire while the 
			confused gunner below figures out what happened. <br /><br />Wraith: 
			<br />Great vehicle. If you see an open tank, jump in... Unless the 
			flag is right there and you can save or take it in, tanks are the 
			best. If the enemy steals the tank that nobody on your team decided 
			to take, you're in for a world of 2 tank hurt. Practice with the 
			main cannon to get a feel for it (sometimes very tricky). Use the 
			boost to ram anybody that gets within 20 feet of you. If somebody 
			is attacking at you, backpedal and boost when they're in range. 
			Don't use the boost as a way to travel fast unless you're in an 
			emergency and fleeing or if you're going long distances where you 
			think you'll be untouched. <br />When boarded, jump out IMMEDIATELY. 
			Unless you're taking a game saving shot, you need to get out fast! 
			You will die very quickly from the beating your opponent will lay 
			down on you. If you jump out quick enough, you can catch them by 
			surprise and lay down a wave of fire before they jump off. <br />
			<br />All other vehicles are left out because... well... I hate them. 
			Not fun at all. Most times (especially on X-box live) they will be 
			left out. <br /><br />Lesse... What other strats do I have packed 
			up? I'll just give some weapons overviews while I think... <br />
			<br />Sniper rifles. Here we go! Human Vs. Covenant. My vote goes 
			to Covenant. While you can fire the Human faster, the Covenant never 
			requires reloading. You may be saying "Hey, overheating is just as 
			bad!" Wrong! Manual reloading has to be done while holding the weapon 
			while cool down can be done while using another weapon. Shoot with 
			the beam rifle until you overheat (slow down to prevent this) and 
			then switch to whatever weapon you have (try a Battle Rifle to 
			keep the long range going or a shotgun so you aren't so vulnerable 
			at close range). Many times I'll grab both snipers and use the 
			Covenant rifle until it overheats and switch to human. Also, I believe 
			the covenant rifle has a better trail... I believe it dims faster, 
			though I'm not totally sure. Though it is bright and purple, you've 
			just killed the only one likely to see it. Nobody else will see the 
			lingering trail and find you... <br />One important thing when 
			sniping, regardless of rifle type, is un-zooming. Do this often to 
			check your motion sensor. I've saved myself countless times by?
			instead of staying zoomed?un-zooming and zooming back on a new spot 
			when target scanning. Another little doodad, when sniping, is the 
			un-zoom feature. If you click and hold the zoom button and then 
			release it, you'll zoom on the click and un-zoom on the release. 
			This is useful for scouting targets using the 5x zoom. Most times, 
			I don't use the 10x zoom when scouting. Although, I must admit, I 
			don't use the un-zoom technique too often. If you see a target in 
			5x zoom, you'll want to zoom in towards them, and there's no way 
			to not un-zoom. Seems a bit of a hassle to zoom, find a guy, 
			un-zoom, zoom, zoom, aim, fire. It's an acquired taste, I guess. 
			Use it if it works for you, don't if it doesn't. <br /><br />Rocket 
			Launcher: <br />Basically, if you exist, you're good with a rocket 
			launcher. Remember to fire it at the ground. Jumping helps you get 
			a better shot at the enemies feet. Be sparing with rockets, though... 
			If you damage with one rocket and have the time, switch to your other 
			weapon and make quick work of him. Even an SMG can kill a man 
			damaged by a rocket quickly. <br />Lock on is, of course, very 
			important. Here's a fun little trick with that. Sometimes when 
			you lock on (on coagulation for instance) the enemy will go over a 
			hill. To get around this, lock on and fire up into the air (quickly).
			If done correctly, you can easily avoid many obstacles. I've shot 
			around walls and around friendly troops to take out a warthog. Also, 
			it scares the living crap out of friendlies to have a rocket spiral 
			at your face, quickly turn and take out a loaded hog... <br /><br />
			Carbine: <br />Good quick shooting, aim for the head. <br /><br />
			Sword: <br />Lock on and kill. Simple enough... This is good for 
			camping (though I dislike camping). Also, if an enemy is rushing 
			at you from medium range, duck around a corner and get in an ambush 
			position. Watch your motion sensor and kill the bastard. Big warning, 
			people are used to this tactic. They likely will throw grenades around 
			the corner to kill you. Duck as far back as you can and wait til' they 
			expel their grenades. Also, watch out for shotguns. <br /><br />
			Battle Rifle: <br />Use in conjunction with frag grenades or a plasma 
			pistol. Otherwise, this gun isn't a good choice. <br /><br />SMG: <br />
			Good for doubles and works well with any other double-able weapon. 
			Exception: Needler... Still sucks! The SMG paired with any plasma 
			weapon will do the work on the body. The plasma will take down 
			shields and the SMG will finish them off. The is good with plasma 
			pistol, but my personal favorite is with the Magnum. That's one of 
			the best combos in the game. <br /><br />Plasma Pistol: <br />Use 
			with Battle Riffle or with Magnum. One hit with magnum or BR to the 
			head after a charged shot is a one hit kill. If you're not charging 
			this weapon, you're wasting your time. This is also effective with 
			the SMG. <br /><br />Plasma Rifle: <br />Not good alone or with another 
			plasma weapon, great with SMG and admirable with Magnum. With SMG, 
			use at close range or medium close range unless you fire with the 
			plasma rifle then switch to firing with the SMG. <br /><br />Magnum: 
			<br />Great weapon. Doubles are extremely effective with good accuracy 
			(head shots) and with an SMG, this is deadly. The SMG will help take 
			the shields down fast and the magnum will kill with a headshot. Great 
			at close to medium range. <br /><br />Brute Shot: <br />Use mainly 
			for medium-long range when no other option is available. Also, when 
			at close range, take a few shots then melee. VERY powerful melee. 
			(all brute shot matches are interesting) <br /><br />Brute Plasma 
			Rifle: <br />Stronger than regular rifle, but much quicker overheat. 
			Not on any levels normally. <br /><br />All other weapons not worth 
			the time... <br /><br />Warning: whenever firing double weapons, 
			other than plasma pistol and pistol, the accuracy of both weapons 
			are drastically lowered. <br /><br />Smacking: <br />Not a very 
			good technique. If their shields are down, go for it, but don't go 
			for a completely smacking kill unless it'll be an assassination. 
			<br />Unless, of course, you have either the flag or the bomb. 
			Typically, these weapons have extra smacking damage. 2 smacks, 
			typically, will kill. Beating down a sword guy with the bomb is 
			SO satisfying... <br /><br />Random stuff: You can jump to the 
			top of the blue base from the big open area in ascension. Also, 
			to the sniper rifle spot. <br />On Coagulation, jump from the back 
			of the base to the top by crouching at the peak of your jump(takes 
			a while to get used to). <br />On Zanzibar. Ride the fan to the 
			top and jump down on the rocket... Throw a grenade (plasmas are easier) 
			into the sword place to knock it down to the fan bottom. Jump into 
			the sea wall by jumping at the curved area and ducking at the end. 
			There is a really tough jump that you can make from a wall underneath 
			the rocket launcher to the bottom ledge of the rocket launcher area. 
			<br />On Ascension. Jump onto the weird structure over the overshield 
			and over on the middle area (quick way up). Jump out of the sniper 
			tower (main base) and kill anybody trying to come up at you (sneaks 
			on top of them). <br />On Waterworks, land on the beam over the 
			enemy base for a nice shot at the flag after throwing a few grenades. 
			Shoot down the stalactites which can crush vehicles (I believe) 
			and players. Also, fly up to the top machine thingy in the middle. 
			Fly to the side and you have a snipe spot that can take out most 
			anybody in the map. Be careful when landing, if done incorrectly 
			your banshee is crushed by the machine. <br />On Headlong. Fly 
			around with the banshee and you can find some awesome snipe spots 
			on the tops of buildings. <br />On Colossus: Cheap assness... 
			Bounce the flag off of the conveyer belt onto the other side. 
			Non-cheap assness... Jump from the plasma rifle to the enemy ground 
			floor. Stand on the rail near the teleporter thing and jump up. 
			Also, grab the overshield which spawns very quickly. <br />On Midship: 
			Play around with the plasma grenades. If you throw it right, you 
			can get the energy sword near your base... Also, you can jump from 
			the top platform into a base or throw a flag up to somebody at the 
			top. <br />Beaver Creek: Try hiding in trees... Not too useful, but 
			fun. Also, throwing flag up to roof then jumping through the 
			teleporter, and throwing it up to another guy up top... Takes like 
			10 seconds if done slowly... <br />Burial mounds: No great secrets 
			on this... Jumping up through the front of the base... <br />
			Foundation: No great secrets... You can hid behind some crates 
			there and camp a base... Make sure your team has both rockets before 
			you do this... Basically, use the rockets and turrets on this map. 
			<br /><br />Every other strategy is instanced... 
			Just a bunch of small "hey you can jump here with this" things that 
			are barely worth the mention. Well, if you read all of this, have 
			fun playing halo 2... </div>
