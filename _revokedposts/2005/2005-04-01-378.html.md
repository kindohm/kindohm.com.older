<p><a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/" target="_blank">Jason</a> and I have officially launched the site for our collaborative musical project: <a href="http://www.sidetrackedproject.net/" target="_blank">The Sidetracked Project</a>. Go check it out. Learn all about it.</p>
<p>I'm really stoked about it. It's the first time I've really ever done any musical/songwriting collaboration with anyone, and it's been a blast so far in its short existence. My own music is fun, but I think this is going to be pretty damn good.</p>
