<p><a href="http://hockeyrumors.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Eklund's Hockey Rumors</a> is a fantastic blog.&nbsp; I don't know much about the guy yet, but he definately seems to have some <strong><em>very</em></strong> close ties and inside relationships with players and agents. &nbsp;He updates very frequently, and it's insane reading stuff like this:</p>
<p><em>More rumors from the edge....<br/><br/>Chris Pronger got traded to Edmonton for Eric Brewer, Jeff Woywitka, and Doug Lynch.<br/><br/>Naslund signed with the Canucks.<br/><br/>Dallas thought they signed Modano, then Boston made another offer, and now nothing is certain..in fact Chicago may be involved...<br/><br/>Naslund re-signed with Vancouver.<br/><br/>Kariya strongly rumored to San Jose.<br/><br/>Kovalev to Montreal is a good possibility.<br/><br/>Martin Skoula signed with Dallas.<br/><br/>Lindros to Nashville or Toronto by Friday. <br/><br/>Pittsburgh made a huge push for Niedermayer...Calgary or Vancouver are involved as well<br/><br/>Rafalski could be a Blue Jacket or could end up back in NJ. (other teams involved.)<br/><br/></em></p>
