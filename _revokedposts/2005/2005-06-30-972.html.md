title: "Drawing more boundaries with Avalon"
---

<p>Last night I made more progress on <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/06/29/965.aspx">drawing Minnesota geography</a>.&nbsp; I spiffed up the UI a bit to allow the user to pick the cities they want to include and also added some zoom/panning controls.&nbsp; Right now everything is just with text boxes - ultimately I'd like to use sliders.&nbsp; Below is a screenshot with some of the metro cities along with some outstate cities:</p>

<p>Next I really want to start getting the zoom and panning functions to work. <a href="http://iwkid.blogspot.com" target="_blank">IW Kid</a> gave me a few suggestions about how to tackle it. His suggestion was to draw the graphics on a "canvas" and then use a "camera" to view the canvas at any point. Avalon DOES have a <a href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/winfx/ref/ns/system.windows.media.media3d/c/camera/camera.asp" target="_blank">Camera</a> class that is used in a <a href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/winfx/ref/ns/system.windows.controls/c/viewport3d/viewport3d.asp" target="_blank">ViewPort3D</a> object. So what does this mean? This means I have to go 3D.&nbsp; My app will need to go to &#8220;11&#8220;. Right now I'm just drawing everything as 2D.</p>
<p>This idea is turning out to work pretty well so far. I haven't parsed and hooked up any of the <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/06/27/952.aspx">census data</a> yet, but I think that will be icing on the cake compared to drawing all of the city, state, and zip code boundaries on the screen. </p>
