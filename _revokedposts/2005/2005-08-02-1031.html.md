title: "MN Wild select-a-seat, pictures of the X"
---

<p>Tonight we went to the MN Wild select-a-seat in an attempt to find some nicer seats to upgrade to (not that ours are bad at all), but we didn't find anything better.&nbsp; There were two open seats one row down from us, but we liked the angle of our seats better.&nbsp; Ours are just behind one of the goal lines on the side of the arena and it's a great vantage point to see plays develop and goals scored.</p>
<p>I brought along our camera just for fun, and got a few good pictures.&nbsp; All of the pictures can be viewed in the <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery/albums/41.aspx">2005 select-a-seat gallery</a>, but some highlights are below.</p>
<p>Perhaps two of the most interesting sights there were of the modifications they've made to the arena for the new rules this season.&nbsp; The goals have been moved back toward the boards, and some red lines have been added to define a zone behind the goals where goalies are limited to play the puck:</p>

<p>Other than that, the rest are just kinda fun:</p>
