<p>I got quite a bit done this weekend:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Put in the ceiling in the bathroom.&nbsp; The existing joists can't be used as the ceiling because of the pipes in the way.</li> 
<li>Added the bathroom ceiling exhaust fan.</li> 
<li>Finished wiring the bathroom (still have to strip a few wires though).</li> 
<li>Reworked the return air flashing duct in the living room by replacing the hex-head sheet-metal screws that fastened it down with flat-head roofing nails.</li> 
<li>Ran some coax cable for the TV line</li></ul> 
<p>Next up is &#8220;the big soffit&#8221;.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll start that this coming weekend.</p>
<p>I ended up listening to a 2-disc Lee Perry compilation while working this weekend: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000457AB/qid%3D1113774453/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/103-3152961-1267838" target="_blank">Son of Thunder</a>.&nbsp; Highly recommended.</p>
