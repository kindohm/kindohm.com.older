title: "Air Holes"
---

<p>Here's a little tip for those of you who get coffee from Caribou or Starbucks or wherever.&nbsp; Most plastic lids they put on coffee cups have one large hole for sipping and a tiny hole on the opposite side to let air through.&nbsp; Most of the time that tiny air hole isn't big enough and it gets clogged with either coffee or a coffee bubble.&nbsp; As a result, coffee doesn't come out of the sipping hole until you tip the cup back far enough and let the pressure build up enough so that the blockage in the air hole gives way and lets&nbsp;air through.&nbsp; By doing this, you risk a large stream of coffee suddenly rushing out of the sipping hole and onto your face.&nbsp; This is what I call &#8220;bursting the dam&#8221;.&nbsp; On work mornings, this is especially inconvenient.</p>
<p>The solution?&nbsp; Make the air hole bigger before you take your first sip.&nbsp; I usually have a pen in my car, and pens work really well for making the holes bigger.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't know if Microsoft gives them out any more, but when you got your MCSD certification for VB6 or C++ they gave you a lapel pin.&nbsp; Believe it or not, I actually have seen interview candidates in suits wearing their MCSD pin on their suit jackets.&nbsp; Please....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyway, those MCSD pins work great for making the holes bigger too.&nbsp; I don't know if the MCSD .Net certs will provide the same benefit though.</p>
