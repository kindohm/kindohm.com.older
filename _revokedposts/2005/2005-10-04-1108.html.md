<p>This bugs me:</p>
<p><em><code>Please wait while your personal site is setup for the first time and the default document libraries and lists are created. This may take several seconds.</code></em></p>
<p>This is the message that SharePoint displays when creating a user's <em>My Site</em>. "Setup" is not a verb, damnit. If you don't believe me, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=setup&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">ask Webster</a>. I've been seeing this everywhere lately. Advertisements, documents, articles, and in applications. I care enough about you and your grammar that I'm spending the time to point this out [1]. So please, say "set up" when you are setting something up. </p>
<p>[1] Plus, I'm sophisticated (so says <a href="http://www.developstuff.com/" target="_blank">Jake</a>). I iron my shirts, have a rain coat, and go to concert band rehearsals on Mondays.</p>
