title: "New Image Gallery"

<p>The way I was managing images/photos on my site was starting to get out of hand.&nbsp; I basically used a big Xml file that held all of the folder and image data such as paths, names, and descriptions.&nbsp; I was also using a home-grown thumbnail generation app to create all of the thumbnails.&nbsp; In short, the process of generating thumbnails and adding data to the Xml file was getting annoying since I had to go through it even if I wanted to just add one image to a folder.&nbsp; Sure, I could just write my own image library app in ASP.Net, but I'm not willing to spend the time to make it as good as I would want it to be and there are already other ASP.Net-based apps out there that already have such functionality.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.nGallery.org">nGallery</a>.&nbsp; I'm now using nGallery to store and display all of the image libraries on the site.&nbsp; nGallery doesn't have&nbsp;100% of the features I'd want, but it's a significant improvement from what I had before and was simple to get set up and running.&nbsp; To get to the new gallery, you can either click on the Pictures link at the top of the site or navigate to <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery">http://www.kindohm.com/nGallery</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
