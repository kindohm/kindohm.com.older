title: "New Clearscreen CAPTCHA Control"
---

<p>For those of you who use the Clearscreen CAPTCHA web control, a new version (1.3) is available <a href="http://blogs.clearscreen.com/migs/archive/2005/02/01/905.aspx">here</a>.&nbsp; The new version is much better than 1.2 - as you don't have to mess with adding handlers in your web.config file.&nbsp; It also works on my web server on my computer at home, which it didn't before for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
