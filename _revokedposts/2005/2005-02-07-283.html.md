title: "Beta Beta Beta Beta Slowwwwwww Beta"
---

<p>Last fall I rebuilt my home computer after Nikki and I noticed that it was starting to run a little slow.&nbsp; I figured it had been&nbsp;about 2&nbsp;years since I rebuilt it last so it was definately time to do it again.&nbsp; But after rebuilding it, it was still slow.&nbsp; We've just been dealing with it, but it was getting really annoying.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then it hit me.&nbsp; The VS .Net&nbsp;2005/.Net Framework 2.0&nbsp;Beta.&nbsp; I installed it about a month before rebuilding, and immediately after rebuilding.&nbsp; &#8220;That had to be it&#8221;, I said to myself.&nbsp; Then I said, &#8220;I like carp&#8221;, and &#8220;aluminum trombone pleasantry&#8221;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, I uninstalled the Beta and &#8220;poof&#8221;!&nbsp;&nbsp;In a spectacular burst of 1's and 0's the good 'ol Gateway was running like it was brand new again.&nbsp; I didn't have VS .Net 2005 to play with anymore, but that's ok because I haven't really touched it for a few months anyway.&nbsp; Plus, my beefy for-work-only Dell Inspiron (outfitted with a Virtual PC for Beta software) can more than handle it if I want to dig back in to operator overloading, generics, or ASP.Net membership anytime soon.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What's the moral of the story?&nbsp; 1's and 0's are hard to clean up off the floor after they burst spectacularly.</p>
