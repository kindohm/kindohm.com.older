title: "I walked the line"
---

<p>Nikki and I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358273/">Walk the Line</a> on Friday.&nbsp; Not too bad, except that it was pretty much the same movie as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350258/">Ray</a>.&nbsp; Maybe it was the unfortunate and coincidental timing of each artists' death, or maybe it was Hollywood just trying to repeat the success of another hit movie.&nbsp; But Walk the Line seemed like the same story told the same way about a lost musical legend - just a different musical genre.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The acting was excellent.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/">Phoenix</a> was spectacular.&nbsp; I'd recommend seeing it, but if you didn't like Ray then you might want to think twice.&nbsp; </p>
