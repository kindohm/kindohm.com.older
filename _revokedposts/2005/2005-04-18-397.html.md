title: "Halo 2 Auto Update"
---

<p>I have a gig after work so I doubt I'll be able to download the update and try it tonight, but I'm very eager to get it and experience the gameplay changes and new maps.</p>
<p>But what's been fun so far is observing some of the forum dialog over at <a href="http://www.bungie.net">www.bungie.net</a>.&nbsp; Lots of people are pissed about the update - because they're being banned for using hacked profiles or&nbsp;for&nbsp;some other unallowed modification to their console or XBL account.&nbsp; Lots of unhappy campers :)&nbsp; The best thing is that they're pleading with Bungie to be un-banned while the majority of them knew that what they were doing wasn't allowed.&nbsp; Not a lot of talk about the actual gameplay mods yet.&nbsp; We shall see very soon...</p>
