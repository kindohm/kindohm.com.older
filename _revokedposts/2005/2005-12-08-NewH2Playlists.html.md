title: "A couple of new playlists"
---

<p>If you're still an active Halo 2 gamer, <a href="http://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Bungie</a> has put out a couple of new matchmaking playlists for Halo 2 that are a bit interesting: <em><strong>Rumble Armory</strong></em> and <em><strong>Team ActionSack</strong></em>. I have to admit that I think the names are cool :).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/page.aspx?section=FAQInfo&amp;subsection=playlists&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Get the details here</a>. Rumble Armory is unranked because it's so bizzare. I played a few of the new playlist games yesterday after work and they were a nice change from the same old slayer/ctf/BR/human games.</p>
