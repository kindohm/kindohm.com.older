	I'm not into Halo 2 as much as I used to be, but I've had my eye on the new <a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=relic&amp;p=3762564">Relic map</a> since I heard about it and saw glimpses of it.&nbsp; There's a <a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=relic&amp;p=3762564">new article</a> on it over at Bungie.net that describes it in detail.&nbsp; Like Zanzibar, Relic looks and feels like no other map.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;that's because of its asymmetry and its &#8220;natural&#8221; appearance and environment.&nbsp; Teams will have to put a lot of brain power into CTF and assault, and the map has&nbsp;many unique features that will keep things interesting.&nbsp; The article does a good job of explaining the map along with some strategic details.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="http://files3.bungie.org/Relic_640x480.wmv">video</a> that highlights some gameplay and a few of the neat features of the map (available on a halo.bungie.org video page: <a href="http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/maptacularvids.html">http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/maptacularvids.html</a>).&nbsp; The video page also has videos of some of the other newer maps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While I'm eager to see and play the new map, I'm skeptical I'll actually enjoy it as much as I hope.&nbsp; I just don't meet up with friends online or in person to play Halo 2 as much as I used to.&nbsp; </p>
