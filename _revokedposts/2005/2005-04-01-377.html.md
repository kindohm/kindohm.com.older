title: "Last day of work"
---

<p>It's the last day of work before the big trip to Antarctica.&nbsp; This will be the last big vacation that Nikki and I take before the baby comes, and probably for a while after the baby arrives too.&nbsp; Up until now, the excitement of the trip hadn't really set in, but now I can definately feel it.&nbsp; I'm so stoked.</p>
<p>We're pretty excited to see icebergs and penguins and stuff.&nbsp; We're also hoping to see some remote weater stations and some desolate science labs.&nbsp; Maybe some AT-AT walkers too.&nbsp; And a Tauntaun.</p>
