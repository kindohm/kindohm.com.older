<p>If you've always wanted to tell me how bad my music is but never had the guts to say it to my face, then today is the day you've been waiting for!&nbsp; Each album page now allows comments, so you can write about how my guitars are out of tune, how I can't sing, or that I don't have a clue about songwriting.&nbsp; Get started by clicking on the <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2005/05/17/Music.aspx">Music</a> link.&nbsp; </p>
