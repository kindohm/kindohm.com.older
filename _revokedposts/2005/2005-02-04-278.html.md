<p>I thought for sure the season would be cancelled today after Bettman and Goodenow met yesterday.  But it looks like they're still talking.  I'm taking that as a good sign that they're genuinely still trying to save the season.  I guess that's all a hockey fan can ask for right now.  I'm not optimistic that the season will be saved, but at least they're doing what they can...  I think.</p>
<p>But this is it man.  This is the day.  THE day.  The day I've been dreading for about 2 years.  I never thought the negotiations would come to this.</p>
