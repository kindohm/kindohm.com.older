title: "The NHLPA breaks first"
---

<p>Wow.&nbsp; I thought the NHL season would be cancelled last week, and now it'll likely be tomorrow (Wednesday), but now the NHLPA and the league are in last-minute hard-core negotiations.&nbsp; But what's even more shocking is that the NHLPA has stood down and offered a salary cap: <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=114925&amp;hubName=nhl">link</a> [<a href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=114925&amp;hubName=nhl" target="_blank">^</a>]</p>
<p>After the months of tension, meaningless negotiations and rhetoric, the NHLPA finally broke down from their hard-line stance against a cap.&nbsp; Since the World Cup of Hockey last summer we were all wondering which side would break first.&nbsp; I thought it would be the NHLPA because they have the biggest stake in the dispute: it's their livelyhood.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However the NHL rejected the deal.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;suprised by that.&nbsp; It's still too far away from what the owners are looking for and the cap needs to be lower than what the NHLPA offered.&nbsp; When I read the first sentence of the article I thought for sure we'd be seeing hockey soon.&nbsp; But then I read on and couldn't believe it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now that the NHLPA has offered a cap, there <strong><em>has</em></strong> to be some common ground to meet on.&nbsp; Unless the league has already made up its mind to cancel the season regardless of what is talked about this week, I don't believe that the two sides can't reach an agreement.</p>
