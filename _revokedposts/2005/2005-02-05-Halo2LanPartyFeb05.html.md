<p>So last night was the most recent <a href="http://kindohm.com/LanPartyDetail.aspx?PartyID=JH23KHDIUFYISDIJ2H3KLRHJFL9IUDF98">Halo 2 bash</a>, and it was swell.  We started getting set up around 5:00, probably started playing around 6:00, and the last of us went home at about 2:00 a.m.  Russ was a very gratious host - letting 13 people invade his basement and providing brewskis and snacks for everyone.  Jay was kind enough to pursuade his neighbor to lend us a 16-port switch for our 8 XBox consoles and TVs.  </p>
<p>We started out with some Slayer and a few different team games like team slayer, team ball, team King, etc.  At some point we started playing 1-flag CTF on Zanzibar, and things got a bit more intense.  The good team (my team) crushed the bad team (not my team) with a 3-to-1 six-round victory.  Then the bad team wanted a rematch.  In game two, Russ's son John woke up and started pwning the game with the sniper rifle, and it turned out to be ridiculously bad for us as we lost 3-1 in another six-round match.    We had to settle it once and for all with a third and final deciding match, but John kept putting us down non-stop and we lost again.  Since each round is about 3 minutes, the three games were a total hour of intense battles, and we all took a quick breather afterward.</p>
<p>After that it was back to a mix of Slayer and team games, including some <em>007</em> (all magnums and no shields) and <em><a href="http://www.mlgpro.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=374&amp;topic=4&amp;newlang" target="_blank">Dawn of the Dead</a></em>.  I personally really like <em>007</em>.  </p>
<p>A few people here and there left starting around 11:00 p.m., but after midnight six of us stuck around to keep going.  Some Assault on Beaver Creek, CTF on Lockout and Beaver Creek, <em>007</em> on Burial Mounds, Swords on Lockout.  </p>
<p>John and I took a bunch of pictures and I hope to have them posted tomorrow or sometime next week.  Overall I had a really great time, and I hope everyone else thought the same.  Let's see...  sometime in late March or early April we'll probably do the next one.  </p>
