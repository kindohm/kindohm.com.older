<p>I couldn't help it.&nbsp; Now that my <a href="http://kindohm.com/archive/2004/12/12/180.aspx" target="_blank">last CD</a> is done, I'm back at it again and have been working on 11 new songs. After 3 months, I've taken the drums out of storage and plan on laying down some drum tracks next week before Christmas. Here are some pics.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The basement still isn't finished, so note the make-shift cardboard sound baffle to reduce the reflection off the concrete walls:<br/><img src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/studio01.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>Note the dust on the cymbals.&nbsp; Dust helps give cymbals character in their sound, you know:<br/><img src="http://www.kindohm.com/images/studio02.jpg" border="0"></p>
