If you're installing <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog"><a title=".Text" href="http://scottwater.com/blog" target="_blank">.Text</a> </a>(a.k.a. <a href="http://www.communityserver.og">Community Server :: Blogs</a>) on a web server where .Net 2.0 has been installed, you may want&nbsp;to change the application running .Text so that is uses .Net 1.1.&nbsp; By default, new IIS applications will try to run 2.0.&nbsp; Leaving it at 2.0 will result in a number of exceptions being thrown at runtime.&nbsp; I've yet to figure out how to configure the application to run on 2.0 without errors.
