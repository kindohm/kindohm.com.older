<h2>About Mike Hodnick</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/head.jpg" alt="head" width="175" class="pull-right" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
	I am an independent software developer and consultant in the 
	<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d116203!2d-93.1667415!3d44.9693244">Twin Cities</a>.
	I like to produce music and I have a nerd obsession with synthesizers and 
	computer-based music. I help organize 
	<a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a>.
	I play hockey, Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program, Halo, drums, and 
	classical percussion.</p>

<p>For more information on my specific technical interests and history,
	please take a look at my <a href="/forhire.html">For Hire</a> page.</p>

<p>I grew up in Duluth, MN and graduated from the University of Minnesota Duluth
	with a BS in Industrial Engineering. I was a wanna-be music major, but felt
	that my calling was with something technical. Throughout my engineering studies
	my interest in computer programming grew significantly. My natural curiosity of
	computer programming and building better software has never stopped.</p>

<p>I've kept my musical roots, but as time goes on I perform (the drums) less 
	and less. These days I have a much greater interest in the technical aspects
	of producing sound. I'm more interested in tweaking the knobs on an FM synthesizer and
	making unusual sounds than actually writing a song. I've also dabbled with
	writing FM synthesis code and building my own sounds in .NET and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I'm not much of a gamer, but when I play video games I play them intensely.
	I've been a long-time fan of the Halo franchise and I love Forge map editing.
	I'm also a Minecraft fan and build huge worlds with my daughter in creative
	multiplayer. Lately I've been interested in <a href="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal
	Space Program</a>, an open sandbox environment where you build and fly
	rockets with realistic physics in a system similar to our Solar System.</p>

<p>I love the game of ice hockey. I've followed it since I was a kid, and have 
	been able to skate since I was a kid, but I never played the game until a
	few years back. I play year-round in an <a href="http://ahahockey.com">adult
	rec league</a>. Not since performing drums on stage as a kid have I found an
	activity where I can forget the rest of the world and just focus and have
	fun.</p>

<p>I like to cook food and prepare meals for my family. I'm no chef, but I keep
	learning basic food preparation and cooking techniques and enjoy trying to
	make new things to eat. My favorite things to make are pot roast, 
	crème brûlée, roasted vegetables, and freshly sliced tomatoes, onions, and
	avacados to top off sandwiches and burgers. Oh, and waffles.</p>
